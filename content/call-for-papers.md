## Full, short, and SoK papers 

Full paper submissions must be at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format (use document option “sigconf”), excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind review. 

Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches.

In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix "SoK:" in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.

## Posters and demos 

WiSec will solicit the submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2026 website.

## Artifact Evaluation label

In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.

Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2026 website.

## Double submissions 

It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed.

## Workshops and Tutorial

ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials that are co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.

## Research Ethics 

The ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public's trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices are not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no "one size fits all" approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication.

While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm.

Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as "human subjects." For WiSec, "human subject research" is defined as "research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans." Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met.

Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advanced tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties

## Policy for Peer-Review Integrity 

All SIGSAC-sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities (https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). Also, all authors, PC members, and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc). Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations). If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.
