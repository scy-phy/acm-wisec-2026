# Call for Posters and Demos

Ciao! ACM WiSec 2025 solicits the submission of posters and demos. The poster and demo session will be part of the WiSec conference, held in person from June 30 to July 3, 2025, in Arlington, Virginia, USA. We especially welcome posters and demos related to the WiSec’25 call for paper topics listed at https://wisec2025.gmu.edu/. 
Posters allow submissions of ideas and preliminary results about ongoing research. Authors should submit up to a 2-page extended abstract that provides sufficient technical details so that the evaluation committee can assess the technical merit of the work. The abstract does not need to present a completed project. Still, it should provide enough concrete evidence to support the proposed ideas’ potential and validity, emphasizing their relevance to wireless security and privacy.
Demos show implementations of the proposed prototypes. Authors should submit a 2-page extended abstract describing their technology, its relevance to wireless security and privacy, and highlighting the prototype’s novelty. The abstract should briefly explain what conference participants can see or do during the demonstration. Demos should have a research component and, in particular, should not push a commercial agenda.
The poster and demo abstracts should follow the ACM WiSec 2025 formatting guidelines (with a 2-page limit), and the authors should refer to the paper submission instructions for information related to formatting. Detailed submission instructions can be found on the submission guidelines page.

## Registration

At least one author per submission must be registered as a poster/demo author by the author registration deadline and present the poster/demo at the conference in person.
