# ACM Workshop on Wireless Security and Machine Learning (WiseML) 2026


The ACM Workshop on Wireless Security and Machine Learning (WiseML) 2026 will be held in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (WiSec) 2026. Accepted, registered, and presented papers will appear in the ACM digital library.  

## Scope and background

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing spectrum data and for developing efficient and secure solutions for the IoT, CPS, 5G, NextG, SatCom, and other emerging wireless systems. On the other hand, adversarial machine learning techniques can severely compromise the performance of ML-enabled wireless systems, highlighting an urgent need to better understand and mitigate the impact of adversarial machine learning on wireless technologies.

Developing efficient, robust, and resilient ML algorithms for wireless security is therefore essential, particularly in environments constrained by limited power and computational resources. Such advances are critical to ensuring the integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness of wireless communications. As a result, there is a growing demand for research at the intersection of ML, wireless security, privacy, and robustness to effectively address these challenges.

WiseML aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from the ML, security, privacy, wireless communications, and networking communities worldwide. The workshop will serve as a collaborative forum for presenting cutting-edge research, exchanging ideas, and fostering interdisciplinary partnerships to push the boundaries of knowledge in these important and rapidly evolving areas.
