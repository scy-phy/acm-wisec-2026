# ACM Workshop on Wireless Security and Machine Learning (WiseML 2025)

The ACM Workshop on Wireless Security and Machine Learning (WiseML) 2025 will be held in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (WiSec) 2025. Accepted, registered, and presented papers will appear in the conference proceedings and the ACM digital library.

## Scope and background

Machine learning (ML) has become a powerful tool for analyzing spectrum data and developing efficient and secure solutions for IoT, CPS, 5G, NextG, and other emerging communication systems. However, recent research highlights how adversarial ML (AML) techniques can compromise the performance of ML-based wireless systems, underscoring the urgent need to understand and mitigate AML's impact on wireless technologies.

Developing efficient and robust ML algorithms for wireless security is essential, particularly in environments constrained by power and computational resources. Such advancements are critical to ensuring the integrity and reliability of wireless communications. There is an increasing demand to explore the intersection of ML with wireless security, privacy, and robustness to address these challenges effectively.

To advance this field, our workshop aims to unite researchers and practitioners from the ML, privacy, security, wireless communications, and networking communities worldwide. The workshop provides a collaborative platform for sharing cutting-edge research, exchanging ideas, and fostering partnerships to push the boundaries of knowledge in these vital and rapidly evolving domains.
