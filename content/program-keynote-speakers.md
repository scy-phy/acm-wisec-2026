### Rethinking Resilience in 6G Design: The Missing Link for Mission-Critical Applications

<br/>

{{< spoiler text="Show abstract">}}
As the race to define 6G intensifies, the focus has overwhelmingly centered on maximizing efficiency—whether in cost, spectral utilization, or energy consumption. Yet, resilience and security, the cornerstone attributes for deploying 6G in mission-critical industries such as energy, defense, and healthcare, have been conspicuously absent from the design discourse. This oversight, rooted in legacy approaches to cellular communication, risks undermining 6G’s ability to meet the uncompromising demands of applications where reliability and adaptability are non-negotiable. <br>
In this keynote, I will redefine resilience in the context of next-generation wireless networks, distinguishing it from related concepts such as robustness and reliability, while highlighting how security is inherently embedded within resilience. I will explore the tension between efficiency, complexity, and resilience, revealing how the relentless pursuit of superior performance has led to overly intricate designs that inadvertently compromise the ability to withstand disruptions. By identifying the structural and systemic traits that characterize truly resilient networks, I will offer a roadmap for how 6G design must evolve to integrate resilience as a foundational principle. <br>
Finally, I will introduce practical frameworks for quantifying resilience, equipping researchers and engineers with tools to embed this critical attribute into the DNA of 6G systems. This keynote is a call to action—a rallying cry to rethink the priorities driving 6G innovation. By striking a deliberate balance between efficiency, complexity, and resilience, we can ensure that 6G not only delivers on its promise of performance but also becomes a transformative technology capable of thriving in the most demanding, high-stakes environments.

### Exploring Unanticipated Functionality in Cellular Devices and Networks

<br/>

{{< spoiler text="Show abstract">}}
Telecommunication networks form the backbone of our connected society, enabling global voice and data communication. Yet, beneath their seamless operation lies a complex interplay of signaling protocols, legacy systems, and evolving technologies that have, over the decades, exposed both opportunities for innovation and significant security challenges. While these networks have changed over the past 50 years and complexity has migrated outwards to devices,
one enduring challenge has been a lack of accessibility. <br/>
In this talk, we will discuss some of our recent efforts to better understand functionality on mobile devices by examining command sets and processors. We also look at security assessment techniques and how they can expose vulnerabilities in core cellular infrastructure. A central focus of this talk is the application of
fuzz testing—a powerful technique for discovering implementation flaws and specification ambiguities. Fuzzing involves generating random or mutated inputs and injecting them into target systems to observe unusual behaviors or crashes. In the context of telecom networks, a fuzzing campaign can target the message handling
logic, permuting fields such as the Protocol Discriminator or Bearer Capabilities, causing ASN.1 decoders in some devices to fail, leading to denial-of-service or potentially more severe consequences. <br/>
Through case studies and demonstrations, the talk will reveal how seemingly innocuous fields in call setup messages can destabilize network components or user devices, while also examining how the analysis of messages rather than examining device behavior can lead to the detection of rogue elements in a network.
