# Call for Workshop Proposals

The ACM WiSec 2025 conference will be held physically from June 30th to July 3rd, 2025, at the George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia, USA. ACM WiSec plans to host several workshops co-located with the main conference. We seek proposals from individuals and teams interested in organizing strong workshops. Ideally, each workshop will be a full day, with 4-5 sessions of 1.5 hours each, or half day.

The workshops aim to provide researchers with a forum for presenting early research results and sharing their experiences with the research community. Contributors to the workshops will present novel ideas in a less formal setting, possibly more focused on a specific topic than the regular conference sessions. Whereas we expect that the research presented in the workshops will be less mature than the main conference papers, emphasis will be given to novelty and the potential of a conference submission in the near future. We will coordinate with workshop chairs to ensure that workshops follow a rigorous peer-review process and compose an exciting program for attendees.

Topics for the workshops include, but are not limited to:

* Security and Privacy of IoT systems
* Security for Cyber-physical Systems
* Security for Connected Autonomous Systems (vehicles, robots, UAVs, underwater vehicles)
* Security of NextG Networks
* Security of MmWave Communications
* Wireless Security and Privacy for Healthcare Applications
* Machine Learning for Wireless Security
* Physical Layer Security
* Security for near-field communications (NFC), visible light communications (VLC), and underwater communications.
* Testbeds and platforms for experimental wireless research
