### Cellular Dual-Use Technologies

<br/>

{{< spoiler text="Show abstract">}}
Cellular protocols include specification-level vulnerabilities that have persisted across 4G and 5G. These standard-compliant features enable surveillance tools such as IMSI-catchers and remain unpatched,often treated as intentional design choices. We refer to these as Cellular Dual-Use Technologies: system-level mechanisms critical both for conducting surveillance and for defending against it. Governments rely on them for lawful interception and protection against foreign intelligence, while civil society actors use countermeasures to avoid tracking in repressive environments.<br>
Because these mechanisms originate from core system design, effective mitigation requires specification changes. Access to real-world systems remains limited, and academic research has been largely disconnected from deployed infrastructure. This talk presents two case studies: a localization technique with front-door-level precision, and an analysis of fake base stations and their detection. We conclude by considering how academic work can engage with these challenges despite structural limitations.

### Secure perception for cyber-physical systems

<br/>

{{< spoiler text="Show abstract">}}
Emerging cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely on precise position/time information and exchange location-specific data in real time. A broad gamut of applications, including intelligent transportation and autonomous/unmanned vehicles (aerial, ground or surface), gains prominence. Enabled by wireless networking and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), they offer valuable services yet they can become prime targets for cyber-attacks. The challenge is two-fold: (i) how to secure position/time information for each CPS platform/device and (ii) how to safeguard the CPS from misbehaving devices. This talk discusses how to address this challenge, in particular (i) the security of GNSS-based services, a cornerstone technology for perceiving space and time, and, more briefly, (ii) the security of driving automaton, vulnerable to attacks on cooperative awareness.
