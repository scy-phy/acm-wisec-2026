# Visa Information


ACM WiSec will be held in Washington DC, United States of America. Visa requirements will depend on your nationality and current residence. To confirm whether you require a visa, please check the visa requirements for your nationality at https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html. If a visa is necessary, it is important to apply for it promptly, as visa processing times can be lengthy.

## Visa Support Letter

You may need to submit a visa support letter as part of your visa application process. ACM is offering visa support letters to all registered attendees, authors, students, and committee members of WiSec 2025. These letters will be provided regardless of whether they present a paper or not, as long as they attend the event.

If you require a visa support letter, please fill in the form at https://supportletters.acm.org with the following details:

###### You will need:
- Your name as it appears in your passport
- Your current postal mailing address
- The name of the conference you wish to attend (ACM WiSec 2025)
- If any papers are accepted for the conference, please provide the title, and specify whether you are the sole author or a co-author
- Your email address

Visa support letters are processed in the order they are received. You will receive a PDF letter via email within 7-10 business days. The PDF letter will be a signed electronic version of the original letter. Please print and bring the PDF visa support letter to your visa appointment. The original letter will only be mailed upon explicit request. Kindly note that registered and paid conference participants will receive visa support letters. If a participant withdraws from the conference after receiving the visa support letter, the consulate will be informed accordingly.

Please be aware that ACM does not issue formal letters of invitation for any ACM-sponsored conferences.

Please give 10 business days to ACM for sending your visa support letter.

If you encounter any difficulties with the visa application process or have other concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.

We wish you the best of luck with your travel arrangements!
