### Security and Privacy of Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems

<br/>

{{< spoiler text="Show abstract">}}
Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered as an emerging technology for 6th-generation (6G) wireless and mobile networks. It is expected to enable a wide variety of vertical applications, ranging from the detection of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for protecting critical infrastructure to physiological sensing for mobile healthcare. Despite its significant socioeconomic benefits, ISAC technology also raises critical and unique challenges in system security and user privacy. Being aware of the security and privacy challenges, understanding the trade-off between security and communication performance, and exploring potential countermeasures in real systems are critical to the wide adoption of this technology in various application scenarios. This talk will discuss various security and privacy threats in the emerging ISAC systems as well as potential technical approaches to securing ISAC systems and protecting user privacy at the physical and data layers.
