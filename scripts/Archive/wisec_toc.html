                  <p>5G has been under standardization for over a decade and will drive the world's mobile
                     technologies in the decades to come. One of the cornerstones of the 5G standard is
                     its security, also for devices that move frequently between networks, such as autonomous
                     vehicles, and must therefore be handed over from one network operator to another.
                     We present a novel, comprehensive, formal analysis of the security of the device handover
                     protocols specified in the 5G standard. Our analysis covers both handovers within
                     the 5G core network, as well as fallback methods for backwards compatibility with
                     4G/LTE. We identify four main handover protocols and formally model them in the security
                     protocol verification tool Tamarin. Using these models, we determine for each protocol
                     the minimal set of security assumptions required for its intended security goals to
                     be met. Understanding these requirements is essential when designing devices and other
                     protocols that depend on the reliability and security of network handovers.</p>

                  <p>Smart speakers, such as the Amazon Echo Dot, are very popular and routinely trusted
                     with private and sensitive information. Yet, little is known about their security
                     and potential attack vectors. We develop and synthesize a set of IoT forensics techniques,
                     apply them to reverse engineer the hardware and software of the Amazon Echo Dot, and
                     demonstrate its lacking protections of private user data. An adversary with physical
                     access to such devices (e.g., purchasing a used one) can retrieve sensitive information
                     such as Wi-Fi credentials, the physical location of (previous) owners, and cyber-physical
                     devices (e.g., cameras, door locks). We show that such information, including all
                     previous passwords and tokens, remains on the flash memory, even after a factory reset.
                     This is due to the wear-leveling algorithms of the flash memory and lack of encryption.
                     We identify and discuss the design flaws in the storage of sensitive information and
                     the process of de-provisioning used devices. We demonstrate the practical feasibility
                     of such attacks on 86 used devices purchased on eBay and flea markets. Finally, we
                     propose secure design alternatives and mitigation techniques.</p>

                  <p>Cellular networks connect nearly every human on the planet; they consequently have
                     visibility into location data and voice, SMS, and data contacts and communications.
                     Such near-universal visibility represents a significant threat to the privacy of mobile
                     subscribers. In 5G networks, end-user mobile device manufacturers assign a Permanent
                     Equipment Identifier (PEI) to every new device. Mobile operators legitimately use
                     the PEI to blocklist stolen devices from the network to discourage device theft, but
                     the static PEI also provides a mechanism to uniquely identify and track subscribers.
                     Advertisers and data brokers have also historically abused the PEI for data fusion
                     of location and analytics data, including private data sold by cellular providers.</p> 
                  <p>In this paper, we present a protocol that allows mobile devices to prove that they
                     are not in the blocklist without revealing their PEI to any entity on the network.
                     Thus, we maintain the primary purpose of the PEI while preventing potential privacy
                     violations. We describe a <em>provably-secure</em> anonymous proof of blocklist non-membership for cellular network, based on the RSA
                     accumulators and zero-knowledge proofs introduced by Camenisch and Lysyanskaya (Crypto'02)
                     and expanded upon by Li, Li and Xue (ACNS'07). We show experimentally that this approach
                     is viable for cellular networks: a phone can create a blocklist non-membership proof
                     in only 3432 milliseconds of online computation, and the network can verify the proof
                     in less than one second on average. In total this adds fewer than 4.5 seconds to the
                     rare network attach process. This work shows that PEIs can be attested anonymously
                     in 5G and future network generations, and it paves the way for additional advances
                     toward a cellular network with guaranteed privacy.</p>

                  <p>Remote Attestation (RA) is an interaction between a trusted verifier (Vrf) and one
                     or more remote and potentially compromised devices (provers or Prv-s) that allow the
                     former to measure the software state of the latter. RA is particularly relevant to
                     safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS) where a set of low-end micro-controllers
                     (MCUs), operate under the control of a remote and more powerful controller. In such
                     cases, RA is an effective and relatively efficient means to detect software compromise,
                     e.g., malware infections, on these low-end MCUs that cannot support expensive security
                     mechanisms.</p> 
                  <p>Unfortunately, current RA techniques have a major practical limitation by requiring
                     one or more of: (i) customized hardware support on every Prv; or (ii) physical presence
                     of Vrf, which must be directly connected to all Prv-s, or (iii) secure pre-loading
                     of trusted software. To overcome this limitation, we construct, implement and evaluate
                     a <em>Delegated Attestation</em> (DA) scheme. In it, all Prv-s remain unmodified, meaning that it applies even to
                     already deployed CPS devices. However, there is no requirement for Vrf's physical
                     proximity, hardware support or secure initial software pre-loading. Instead, DA uses
                     a recently proposed primitive (called Proofs-of-Execution or PoX) which entails a
                     single customized low-end embedded device (called Attestation Proxy or Prox) on the
                     same local-area network (e.g., a CAN-bus) as Prv-s. In doing so, DA enables RA of
                     all Prv-s. Importantly, this guarantee holds even if Prox is itself compromised, enabling
                     secure RA of completely unmodified Prv-s in an efficient manner.</p>

                  <p>Vehicular networks rely on Public Key Infrastructure (PKIs) to generate long-term
                     and short-term pseudonyms that protect vehicle's privacy. Instead of relying on a
                     complex and centralized ecosystem of PKI entities, a more scalable solution is to
                     rely on Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) and the use of Trusted Computing elements.
                     In particular, revocation based on DAA is very attractive in terms of efficiency and
                     privacy: it does not require the use of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and revocation
                     authorities can exclude misbehaving participants from a V2X system without resolving
                     (i.e. learning) their long-term identity. In this paper, we present a novel revocation
                     protocol based on the use of DAA and showcase a detailed design and modeling of the
                     implementation on a real TPM platform in order to demonstrate its significant performance

                  <p>Internet of Things (IoT) technology promises to bring new value creation opportunities
                     across all major industrial sectors. This will yield industries to deploy more devices
                     into their networks. A key pillar to ensure the safety and security of the running
                     services on these devices is remote attestation. Unfortunately,existing solutions
                     fail to cope with the recent challenges raised by large IoT networks. In particular,
                     the heterogeneity of the devices used in the network affects the performance of a
                     remote attestation protocol. Another challenge in these networks is their dynamic
                     nature: More IoT devices may be added gradually over time. This poses a problem in
                     terms of key management in remote attestation.</p> 
                  <p>We propose FADIA, the first lightweight collaborative remote attestation protocol
                     that is designed with fairness in mind. FADIA enables fair distribution of load/tasks
                     on the attesting devices to achieve better performance. We also leverage the Eschenauer-Gligor
                     scheme to enable efficient addition of devices to the network. We implement our solution
                     on heterogeneous embedded devices and evaluate it in real scenarios. The evaluation
                     shows that FADIA can (i) increase the lifetime of a network by an order of magnitude
                     and (ii) decrease the remote attestation runtime by a factor of 1.6.</p>

                  <p>Bluetooth pairing establishes trust on first use between two devices by creating a
                     shared key. Similar to certificate warnings in TLS, the Bluetooth specification requires
                     warning users upon issues with this key, because this can indicate ongoing Machine-in-the-Middle
                     (MitM) attacks. This paper uncovers that none of the major Bluetooth stacks warns
                     users, which violates the specification. Clear warnings would protect users from recently
                     published and potential future security issues in Bluetooth authentication and encryption.</p>

                  <p>Today, an increasing number of applications rely on location and proximity information
                     to deliver services. With the introduction of Wi-Fi Fine Timing Measurement (FTM)
                     in the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard, Wi-Fi derived location and proximity information
                     will play a key role in many safety- and security-critical applications. For example,
                     Wi-Fi FTM is adopted in Wi-Fi Aware where it enables geo-fencing and mobile identification.
                     In this paper, we perform the first security analysis of Wi-Fi FTM and analyze its
                     security guarantees across the logical and physical layers. We find various weaknesses
                     that enable an attacker to introduce distance reductions and enlargements to any arbitrary
                     attacker-chosen value, requiring commodity hardware only. We perform an evaluation
                     using commercial access points, smartphones, and off-the-shelf Wi-Fi cards, and show
                     that an attacker can manipulate distances with meter-level precision. Furthermore,
                     we highlight the distance manipulation attacks which are independent of any higher-layer
                     cryptographic protection, exposing fundamental limitations to achieving secure distance
                     measurements in the current standard. Finally, we present security recommendations
                     for the design and implementation of Wi-Fi FTM and next-generation positioning protocols.</p>

                  <p>Even the most resource-constrained IoT devices need to communicate securely. In order
                     to establish a secure channel, key agreement between the communicating parties is
                     used. Today's key agreement protocols require at least three scalar multiplications
                     in the handshake to achieve mutual authentication, forward and backward secrecy, and
                     protection against key-compromise impersonation. As this is a computationally heavy
                     operation, resource-constrained devices benefit from a lower number of scalar multiplications.
                     In this paper we present Julia Key Agreement (JKA), a protocol that satisfies the
                     aforementioned security properties using two scalar multiplications, and thus saves
                     both time and energy. In addition, we define an optimized JKA that only requires a
                     single scalar multiplication for a particular use case.</p>

                  <p>Motivated by the recent push towards adopting new standards and the discovery of numerous
                     vulnerabilities in both new and old protocols, this paper analyzes the security of
                     Wi-Fi networks. Our analysis is based on publicly available datasets and our own survey
                     covering 250,137 networks across four countries in three continents. We present several
                     key insights, including the continued use of outdated security configurations and
                     vulnerable protocols, the adoption rates of modern protocols, the increasing presence
                     of mesh networks as part of smart city infrastructure, and the vast differences depending
                     on the surveyed geographic region and frequency spectrum. Additionally, we identify
                     and improve upon shortcomings in previous surveys, and recommend best practices for

                  <p>The widespread adoption of specialty smart ecosystems has changed the everyday lives
                     of users. As a part of smart ecosystems, Enterprise Internet of Things (E-IoT) allows
                     users to integrate and control more complex installations in comparison to off-the-shelf
                     IoT systems. With E-IoT, users have a complete control of audio, video, scheduled
                     events, lightning fixtures, shades, door access, and relays via available user interfaces.
                     As such, these systems see widespread use in government or smart private offices,
                     schools, smart buildings, professional conference rooms, hotels, smart homes, yachts,
                     and similar professional settings. However, even with their widespread use, the security
                     of many E-IoT systems has not been researched in the literature. Further, many E-IoT
                     systems utilize proprietary communication protocols that rely mostly on security through
                     obscurity, which has perhaps led many users to mistakenly assume that these systems
                     are secure. To address this open research problem and determine if E-IoT systems are
                     vulnerable, we focus on one of the core E-IoT components, E-IoT communication buses.
                     Communication buses are used by E-IoT proprietary protocols to connect multiple E-IoT
                     devices (e.g., keypads and touchscreens) and trigger pre-configured events upon user
                     actions. In this study, we introduce LightningStrike, the implementation of four proof-of-concept
                     attacks that demonstrate several weaknesses in E-IoT proprietary communication protocols
                     through communication buses. With LightningStrike, we show that it is feasible for
                     an attacker to compromise E-IoT systems using E-IoT communication buses. We demonstrate
                     that popular E-IoT proprietary communication protocols are susceptible to Denial-of-Service,
                     eavesdropping, impersonation, and replay attacks. As E-IoT systems control physical
                     access, safety components, and emergency equipment, an attacker with a low level of
                     knowledge and effort can easily exploit E-IoT vulnerabilities to impact the security
                     and safety of users, smart systems, and smart buildings worldwide.</p>

                  <p>Bitcoin has emerged as a revolutionary payment system with its decentralized ledger
                     concept however it has significant problems such as high transaction fees and long
                     confirmation times. Lightning Network (LN), which was introduced much later, solves
                     most of these problems with an innovative concept called off-chain payments. With
                     this advancement, Bitcoin has become an attractive venue to perform micro-payments
                     which can also be adopted in many IoT applications (e.g. toll payments). Nevertheless,
                     it is not feasible to host LN and Bitcoin on IoT devices due to the storage, memory,
                     and processing requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient and
                     secure protocol that enables an IoT device to use LN through an untrusted gateway
                     node. The gateway hosts LN and Bitcoin nodes and can open &amp; close LN channels, send
                     LN payments on behalf of the IoT device. This delegation approach is powered by a
                     (2,2)-threshold scheme that requires the IoT device and the LN gateway to jointly
                     perform all LN operations which in turn secures both parties' funds. Specifically,
                     we propose to thresholdize LN's Bitcoin public and private keys as well as its commitment
                     points. With these and several other protocol level changes, IoT device is protected
                     against revoked state broadcast, collusion, and ransom attacks. We implemented the
                     proposed protocol by changing LN's source code and thoroughly evaluated its performance
                     using a Raspberry Pi. Our evaluation results show that computational and communication
                     delays associated with the protocol are negligible. To the best of our knowledge,
                     this is the first work that implemented threshold cryptography in LN.</p>

                  <p>Growing deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is expected to significantly
                     increase the volume of Basic Safety Messages (BSM) in highways and dense roads. Computational
                     overhead of verifying the integrity of BSMs will therefore be high while current V2V
                     equipment can process only a limited number of BSMs per second. As a result, critical
                     BSMs carrying vital information may fail to be processed on time, creating unsafe
                     outcomes. In this paper, we expose this vulnerability, discuss critical scenarios,
                     develop novel attacks that exploit this vulnerability, and propose a sieving technique
                     to mitigate these verification gridlock attacks. We show on a USRP testbed that our

                     achieves 80% accuracy at SNR greater than 6 dB, effectively mitigating the attack.</p>

                  <p>The advancement in Internet of Things (IoT) technology has transformed our daily lifestyle.
                     Particularly, voice assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant are commonly
                     deployed in households. These voice assistants enable users to interact with other
                     devices in a smart home ecosystem. In this paper, we focus on two security issues
                     that arise with the use of smart speakers, and present network flow fingerprinting
                     methods to mitigate their impact. First, we concentrate on the misactivation of smart
                     speakers in which spoken words unintentionally activate the device. This may lead
                     to private user conversations being recorded and sent to the cloud without the user
                     even noticing. To prevent such misactivation, we explore locality-sensitive hash-based
                     machine learning approaches. Our evaluation results with the network traffic of four
                     different smart speakers show that the proposed approach can achieve an area under
                     the curve (i. e., AUC) of 93% to 99%. Secondly, we explore whether the voice commands
                     of the device owner can be distinguished from other individuals based on the generated
                     network traffic fingerprint without any analysis of the actual sound wave. Evaluation
                     results with five different user voices show that we can achieve an average AUC of
                     72% to 81% by ensembling multiple machine learning models.</p>

                  <p>Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) scanning can be misused by applications to determine a
                     device location. In order to prevent unconsented location tracking by applications,
                     Android conditions the use of some BLE functions to the prior obtention of the location
                     permission and the activation of the location setting. In this paper, we detail a
                     vulnerability that allows applications to perform BLE scans without the location permission.
                     We present another flaw allowing to bypass the active location requirement. Together
                     those flaws allow an application to fully circumvent the location restrictions applying
                     to BLE scanning. The presented vulnerability affects devices running Android 6 up
                     to 11 and could be misused by application developers to track the location of users.
                     This vulnerability has been disclosed to Google and assigned the CVE-2021-0328.</p>

                  <p>The increase of the computational power in edge devices has enabled the penetration
                     of distributed machine learning technologies such as federated learning, which allows
                     to build collaborative models performing the training locally in the edge devices,
                     improving the efficiency and the privacy for training of machine learning models,
                     as the data remains in the edge devices. However, in some IoT networks the connectivity
                     between devices and system components can be limited, which prevents the use of federated
                     learning, as it requires a central node to orchestrate the training of the model.
                     To sidestep this, peer-to-peer learning appears as a promising solution, as it does
                     not require such an orchestrator. On the other side, the security challenges in IoT
                     deployments have fostered the use of machine learning for attack and anomaly detection.
                     In these problems, under supervised learning approaches, the training datasets are
                     typically imbalanced, i.e. the number of anomalies is very small compared to the number
                     of benign data points, which requires the use of re-balancing techniques to improve
                     the algorithms' performance. In this paper, we propose a novel peer-to-peer algorithm,P2PK-SMOTE,
                     to train supervised anomaly detection machine learning models in non-IID scenarios,
                     including mechanisms to locally re-balance the training datasets via synthetic generation
                     of data points from the minority class. To improve the performance in non-IID scenarios,
                     we also include a mechanism for sharing a small fraction of synthetic data from the
                     minority class across devices, aiming to reduce the risk of data de-identification.
                     Our experimental evaluation in real datasets for IoT anomaly detection across a different
                     set of scenarios validates the benefits of our proposed approach.</p>

                  <p>Mobile networks are a crucial part of our digital lives and require adequate security
                     measures. The 4G and 5G network standards are complex and challenging to implement,
                     which led to several implementation issues being discovered over the last years. Consequently,
                     we aim to strengthen automation in testing and increase test coverage to spot issues
                     and potential security vulnerabilities.</p> 
                  <p>In this paper, we explore <em>active automata learning</em> for 4G/LTE protocol state machines. We focus on LTE's Mobility Management Entity
                     (MME), the main core network element that handles all user registration and authentication
                     through the NAS protocol. Based on automata learning, we automatically reconstruct
                     the NAS protocol state machine to study implementation-specific artifacts and their
                     security implications. We design and implement a reliable UE-to-MME interface for
                     testing the MME from the perspective of a user device. This method allows testing
                     of fully functional core networks without modification. Based on a prototype implementation,
                     we test two open-source projects, one commercial MME implementation, and one MME in
                     an operator's test network replicating the live LTE network. We expose several bugs,
                     including crashes in three of the four implementations, potentially leading to network
                     outages.</p>

                  <p>Given the nature of satellites orbiting the Earth on a fixed trajectory, in principle,
                     it is interesting to investigate how this invariant can be exploited for security
                     purposes. In particular, satellite orbit information can be retrieved from public
                     databases. Using time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements from multiple receivers,
                     we can check this orbit information against a corresponding TDOA-based signature of
                     the satellite. In that sense, we propose an orbit-based authentication scheme for
                     down-link satellite communications in this paper. To investigate the properties and
                     fundamentals of our novel TDOA signature scheme we study two satellite systems at
                     different altitudes: Iridium and Starlink.</p> 
                  <p>Clearly, many challenging questions with respect to the feasibility and effectiveness
                     of this authentication scheme arise; to name some: how many receivers are necessary,
                     how should they be distributed, and how many consecutive measurements do we need for
                     the TDOA signatures. We address these questions by a full factorial experimental design
                     using a simulation framework, we developed for that purpose. Besides a deep understanding
                     about the effects of the major factors on the authentication performance, we find
                     that in adequate configurations, even under a versatile attacker, the orbit-based
                     authentication scheme is able to achieve low false authentication rates well below
                     1% at false rejection rates of about 2%, for both, Iridium and Starlink satellites.</p>

                  <p>Trade secrets such as intellectual properties are the inherent values for firms. Although
                     companies have exploited strict access management policies and isolated their networks
                     from the public Internet, trade secrets are still vulnerable to side-channel attacks.
                     Side-channels can reveal the computing processes of computers in forms of various
                     physical signals such as light, electromagnetism, and even heat. Such side-channels
                     can bypass the isolation mechanism and therefore bring about severe threats. However,
                     existing side-channels can only perform well within a short-distance (e.g., less than
                     1 meter) due to the high attenuation of signals. In this paper, we seek to utilize
                     the built-in power lines in a building and construct a power side-channel that enables
                     remote, i.e., cross-outlet attack against trade secrets. To this end, we investigate
                     the power factor correction (PFC) module inside the power supply units of commodity
                     computers and find that the PFC signals observed from an outlet can precisely reveal
                     the power consumption information of all the connected devices, even from the outlets
                     in adjacent rooms. Based upon this insight, we design and implement OutletSpy, a power
                     side-channel attack that can infer application launching from a remote outlet and
                     therefore enjoys the stealthiness property. We validate and evaluate OutletSpy with
                     a dataset under different background APPs, time variations and different locations.
                     The experiment results show OutletSpy can infer the application launching with 98.25%
                     accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Although <em>user</em> authentication has been well explored, <em>device-to-device</em> authentication - specifically in Bluetooth networks - has not seen the same attention.
                     We propose <em>Verification of Interaction Authenticity (VIA)</em> - a recurring authentication scheme based on evaluating characteristics of the communications
                     (<em>interactions</em>) between devices. We adapt techniques from wireless traffic analysis and intrusion-detection
                     systems to develop behavioral models that capture typical, authentic device interactions
                     (<em>behavior</em>); these models enable recurring verification of device behavior. To evaluate our
                     approach we produced a new dataset consisting of more than 300 Bluetooth network traces
                     collected from 20 Bluetooth-enabled smart-health and smart-home devices. In our evaluation,
                     we found that devices can be correctly verified at a variety of granularities, achieving
                     an F1-score of 0.86 or better in most cases.</p>

                  <p>Mobile devices are becoming an indispensable part of work for corporations and governments
                     to store and process sensitive information. Thus, it is important for remote administrators
                     to maintain control of these devices via Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions.
                     ARM TrustZone has been widely regarded as the de facto solution for protecting the
                     security-sensitive software, such as MDM agents, from attacks of a compromised rich
                     OS. However, little attention has been given to protecting the MDM control channel,
                     a fundamental component for a remote administrator to invoke the TrustZone-based MDM
                     agents and perform specific management operations. In this work, we design an ARM
                     TrustZone-based network mechanism, called TZNIC, towards enabling resilient and secure
                     access to TrustZone-based software, even in the presence of a malicious rich OS. TZNIC
                     deploys two NIC drivers, one secure-world driver and one normal-world driver, multiplexing
                     one physical NIC. We utilize the ARM TrustZone-based high privilege to protect the
                     secure-world driver and further resolve several challenges on sharing one set of hardware
                     peripherals between two isolated software environments. TZNIC does not require any
                     changes or collaboration of the rich OS. We implement a prototype of TZNIC, and the
                     evaluation results show that TZNIC can provide a reliable network channel to invoke
                     the security software in the secure world, with minimal system overhead on the rich
                     OS.</p>

                  <p>StrandHogg vulnerabilities affect Android's multitasking system and threaten up to
                     90% of Android platforms, which translates to millions of affected users. Existing
                     countermeasures require modification of the OS, have usability drawbacks, or are limited
                     to the detection of certain attack versions. In this work, we aim to develop a generic,
                     efficient, and usability-friendly attack detection method, which does not require
                     OS modifications and can be employed by apps installed on any vulnerable Android platform.
                     To achieve our goal, we analyze StrandHogg attack techniques and develop two countermeasures,
                     one using Machine Learning and the other one using ActivityCounter - a reliable attack
                     indicator, which we could synthetically engineer. Our first approach achieves an average
                     F1 score of 92% across all attack variations, while ActivityCounter shows superior
                     performance and efficiently detects all attack versions without false positives. ActivityCounter
                     is the first solution without practical limitations, which can be easily deployed
                     in practice and protect millions of affected users.</p>

                  <p>IEEE 802.15.4z, a standard for Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) secure distance measurement,
                     was adopted in 2020 and the chips that implement this standard are already deployed
                     in mobile phones and in the automotive industry (for Passive Keyless Entry and Start).
                     The standard specifies two different modes---LRP and HRP. Whereas the security of
                     LRP mode has been analyzed, there is no publicly available security analysis of the
                     HRP mode, which is used in different chips like NXP Trimension SR150/SR040, Samsung
                     smartphones, and U1 chip deployed in Apple iPhones.</p> 
                  <p>In this work, we perform the first open analysis of the 802.15.4z HRP mode. Our analysis
                     reviews possible attacks on HRP and assesses strategies that an HRP receiver could
                     implement. We show that in realistic deployments, despite countermeasures, HRP is
                     hard to configure to be both performant and secure. If a distance missdetection rate
                     is set to less than 10% (in benign scenarios), the probability of a successful distance
                     shortening attacks ranges from 7% to over 90%.</p>

                  <p>Drones are increasingly associated with incidents disturbing air traffic at airports,
                     invading privacy, and even terrorism. Wireless Direction of Arrival (DoA) techniques,
                     such as the MUSIC algorithm, can localize drones, but deploying a system that systematically
                     localizes RF emissions can lead to intentional or unintentional (e.g., if compromised)
                     abuse. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) provides a solution for controlled computation
                     of the elevation of RF emissions, only revealing estimates when some conditions are
                     met, such as when the elevation exceeds a specified threshold. However, we show that
                     a straightforward implementation of MUSIC, which relies on costly computation of complex
                     matrix operations such as eigendecomposition, in state of the art MPC frameworks is
                     extremely inefficient requiring over 20 seconds to achieve the weakest security guarantees.
                     In this work, we develop a set of MPC optimizations and extensions of MUSIC. We extensively
                     evaluate our techniques in several MPC protocols achieving a speedup of 300-500 times
                     depending on the security model and specific technique used. For instance a Malicious
                     Shamir execution providing security against malicious adversaries enables 536 DoA
                     estimations per second, making it practical for use in real-world setups.</p>

                     pervasive communications infrastructure (including for V2X, Smart Grid, and Healthcare).
                     We disclose and evaluate SigUnder, an attack that enables an adversary to overshadow
                     the Signal Synchronization Block (SSB) with an injected signal at 3.4dB below the
                     legitimate signal (prior work required 3dB above). The attack exploits the polar coding
                     mechanism of 5G and the physical layer OFDM structure. It can be used to make previous
                     DoS and over-shadowing attacks lower-power and stealthy, but also enables new attacks
                     unique to 5G such as setting the cellBarred field in the 5G MIB (and blocking access
                     to a cell). We develop techniques (e.g., phase prediction) to make the attack feasible
                     in a practical setup, and evaluate its performance both in simulations and over the

                  <p>SNOW 3G is a stream cipher used as one of the standard algorithms for data confidentiality
                     and integrity protection over the air interface in the 3G and 4G mobile communication
                     systems. SNOW-V is a recent new version that was proposed as a candidate for inclusion
                     in the 5G standard. In this paper, we propose a faster variant of SNOW-V, called SNOW-Vi,
                     that can reach the targeted speeds for 5G in a software implementation on a larger
                     variety of CPU architectures. SNOW-Vi differs in the way how the LFSR is updated and
                     also introduces a new location of the tap <em>T</em>2 for stronger security, while everything else is kept the same as in SNOW-V. The
                     throughput in a software environment is increased by around 50% in average, up to
                     92 Gbps. This makes the applicability of the cipher much wider and more use cases
                     are covered. The security analyses previously done for SNOW-V are not affected in
                     most aspects, and SNOW-Vi provides the same 256-bit security level as SNOW-V.</p>

                  <p>Existing academic research on vibration-based speech attacks has introduced interesting
                     and intellectually appealing threat vectors with proof-of-concept demonstrations in
                     controlled environments. The attacks presented in these studies exploit different
                     types of sensors such as MEMS motion sensors, laser-based sensors, and some other
                     sensors (camera, position error signal, piezo-disc) to measure the vibrations induced
                     on an object by nearby sensitive speech. Such sensors are commonly found on mobile
                     devices like smartphones and tablets that can be exposed to sensitive speech, revealing
                     the significance of this potential threat. These studies have amassed significant
                     attention in news and media and introduced concern to people about the safety of their
                     day-to-day speech and around their personal, wireless and IoT devices. However, we
                     hypothesize that the controlled experiments in the prior research maintain critical
                     parameter values that are favorable to attack success (deviating from the limiting
                     settings in a real-world scenario) and produce results that suggest a greater real-life
                     threat level than actually exists.</p> 
                  <p>The contributions made in this paper are as follows; First, we provide a detailed
                     review of 10 existing academic research works related to vibration-based eavesdropping
                     attacks. Second, we identify key experimental parameters that can impact the success
                     of eavesdropping in the vibration domain. Third, we build a framework to evaluate
                     the existing literature based on the Percent Parameters in Favored Settings (PPFS)
                     Score metric that we define. Lastly, we use our defined framework to evaluate the
                     feasibility of the existing vibration-based speech attacks to compromise <em>live human speech</em> to the extent of <em>full speech recognition.</em> The results of our evaluation suggest that none of the existing vibration-based eavesdropping

                  <p>In this paper, we build a speech privacy attack that exploits speech reverberations
                     from a smartphone's inbuilt loudspeaker captured via a zero-permission motion sensor
                     (accelerometer). We design our attack Spearphone, and demonstrate that speech reverberations
                     from inbuilt loudspeakers, at an appropriate loudness, can impact the accelerometer,
                     leaking sensitive information about the speech. In particular, we show that by exploiting
                     the affected accelerometer readings and carefully selecting feature sets along with
                     off-the-shelf machine learning techniques, Spearphone can perform gender classification
                     (accuracy over 90%) and speaker identification (accuracy over 80%) for the audio/video
                     playback on the smartphone for our recorded dataset. We use lightweight classifiers
                     and an off-the-shelf machine learning tool so that the attacking effort is minimized,
                     making our attack practical. Our results with testing the attack on a voice call and
                     voice assistant response were also encouraging, showcasing the impact of the proposed
                     attack. In addition, we perform speech recognition and speech reconstruction to extract
                     more information about the eavesdropped speech to an extent. Our work brings to light
                     a fundamental design vulnerability in many currently-deployed smartphones, which may
                     put people's speech privacy at risk while using the smartphone in the loudspeaker
                     mode during phone calls, media playback or voice assistant interactions.</p>

                  <p>Secure ranging is poised to play a critical role in several emerging applications
                     such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial systems, wireless IoT devices, and augmented
                     reality. In this paper, we propose a design of a secure broadcast ranging system with
                     unique features and techniques. Its <em>spectral-flexibility</em>, and <em>low-power short</em> ranging bursts enable co-existence with existing systems such as in the 2.4GHz ISM
                     band. We exploit a set of RF techniques such as <em>upsampling</em> and <em>successive interference cancellation</em> to achieve high accuracy and scalability to tens of reflectors even when operating
                     over narrow bands of spectrum. We demonstrate that it can be implemented on popular
                     SDR platforms FPGA and/or hosts (with minimal FPGA modifications). The protocol design,
                     and cryptographically generated/detected signals, and randomized timing of transmissions,
                     provide stealth and security against denial of service, sniffing, and distance manipulation
                     attacks. Through extensive experimental evaluations (and simulations for scalability
                     to over 100 reflectors) we demonstrate an accuracy below 20cm on a wide range of SNR
                     (as low as 0dB), spectrum 25MHz-100MHz, with bursts as short as 5us.</p>

                  <p>Low-energy Bluetooth devices have become ubiquitous and widely used for different
                     applications. Among these, Bluetooth trackers are becoming popular as they allow users
                     to track the location of their physical objects. To do so, Bluetooth trackers are
                     often built-in within other commercial products connected to a larger crowdsourced
                     tracking system. Such a system, however, can pose a threat to the security and privacy
                     of the users, for instance, by revealing the location of a user's valuable object.
                     In this paper, we introduce a set of security properties and investigate the state
                     of commercial crowdsourced tracking systems, which present common design flaws that
                     make them insecure. Leveraging the results of our investigation, we propose a new
                     design for a secure crowdsourced tracking system (SECrow), which allows devices to
                     leverage the benefits of the crowdsourced model without sacrificing security and privacy.
                     Our preliminary evaluation shows that SECrow is a practical, secure, and effective
                     crowdsourced tracking solution.</p>

                  <p>We propose VoIPLoc, a novel location fingerprinting technique and apply it to the
                     VoIP call provenance problem. It exploits echo-location information embedded within
                     VoIP audio to support fine-grained location inference. We found consistent statistical
                     features induced by the echo-reflection characteristics of the location into recorded
                     speech. These features are discernible within traces received at the VoIP destination,
                     enabling location inference. We evaluated VoIPLoc by developing a dataset of audio
                     traces received through VoIP channels over the Tor network. We show that recording
                     locations can be fingerprinted and detected remotely with a low false-positive rate,
                     even when a majority of the audio samples are unlabelled. Finally, we note that the
                     technique is fully passive and thus undetectable, unlike prior art. VoIPLoc is robust
                     to the impact of environmental noise and background sounds, as well as the impact
                     of compressive codecs and network jitter. The technique is also highly scalable and
                     offers several degrees of freedom terms of the fingerprintable space.</p>

                  <p>The popularity of smart wrist wearable technology (e.g., smart-watches) has rejuvenated
                     the exploration of dynamic biometric-based authentication techniques that employ sensor
                     data from these devices. Despite the progress demonstrated by the scientific community,
                     research in this area has not successfully transitioned to practice, and we are yet
                     to see a mainstream user-authentication product based on a dynamic biometric such
                     as handwriting/hand gestures captured using commercial wrist wearables. This work
                     undertakes an investigative analysis to further explore why that is the case. We accomplish
                     this by studying the feasibility and practical deployability of handwriting-based
                     authentication techniques in the literature that utilize motion sensors on-board wrist
                     wearables. We conduct this analysis by replicating four state-of-the-art and representative
                     handwriting-based authentication schemes that employ wrist motion data, in order to
                     test their viability in realistic hand-writing/gesture scenarios. By using data collected
                     from actual human subjects in an unconstrained fashion, we comparatively evaluate
                     the performance of these schemes with well-defined usability and security metrics.
                     Our experimental results show that some of the tested schemes perform considerably
                     well in practice, and are promising. However, they do suffer from several practical
                     user-dependent and technique-specific challenges that act as roadblocks towards their
                     wide-scale adoption in mainstream applications.</p>

                  <p>With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Zigbee is widely adopted
                     as a resource-efficient wireless protocol. Recently, severe vulnerabilities in Zigbee
                     protocol implementations have compromised IoT devices from different manufacturers.
                     It becomes imperative to perform security testing on Zigbee protocol implementations.
                     However, it is not a trivial task to apply the existing vulnerability detection techniques
                     such as fuzzing to Zigbee protocol implementations. In particular, it remains a significant
                     obstacle to deal with low-level hardware events. Many existing protocol fuzzing tools
                     lack a proper execution environment for the Zigbee protocol, which communicates via
                     a radio channel instead of the Internet.</p> 
                  <p>To bridge the above gap, we develop a device-agnostic fuzzing platform named <em>Z-Fuzzer</em> to detect security vulnerabilities in Zigbee protocol implementations. Z-Fuzzer provides
                     a software simulation environment with pre-defined peripherals and hardware interrupts
                     configurations to simulate Zigbee protocol execution on real IoT devices. We first
                     extend the existing protocol fuzzing framework's capabilities with a proxy server
                     to bridge communication with the Zigbee protocol execution. Second, we generate more
                     high-quality test cases with code-coverage heuristics. We compare Z-Fuzzer with advanced
                     protocol fuzzing tools, BooFuzz and Peach fuzzer, on top of Z-Fuzzer's simulation
                     platform. Our results show that Z-Fuzzer can achieve higher code coverage in a mainstream
                     Zigbee protocol implementation called Z-Stack. Z-Fuzzer has detected more vulnerabilities
                     using fewer test cases than BooFuzz and Peach. Three of them have been assigned CVE
                     IDs with high CVSS scores (7.5~8.2).</p>

                  <p>In mobile networks, IMSI-Catchers identify and track users simply by requesting all
                     users' permanent identities (IMSI) in range. The 5G standard attempts to fix this
                     issue by encrypting the permanent identifier (now <em>SUPI</em>) and transmitting the <em>SUCI.</em> Since the encrypted SUCI is re-generated with an ephemeral key for each use, an attacker
                     can no longer derive the user's identity. However, this scheme does not prevent all
                     tracking and linking: if the identity of a user is already known, an attacker can
                     <em>probe</em> users for that identity.</p> 
                  <p>We demonstrate a proof-of-concept 5G SUCI-Catcher attack in a 5G standalone network.
                     Based on prior work on linkability through the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA)
                     procedure, we introduce an attack variant that enables practical, repeatable attacks.
                     We capture encrypted SUCIs and use the AKA-procedure to link the encrypted identities
                     between sessions. This answers <em>Is user X present now?</em> --- a typical scenario for IMSI-Catchers. We analyze the attack's scalability, discuss

                  <p>Over the years, numerous weaknesses have been identified in the IEEE 802.11 standard
                     and its implementations. In order to present a proof-of-concept or demonstrate their
                     impact in practice, researchers are often required to implement entire procedures
                     or complex features from scratch (e.g., injecting encrypted frames with customized
                     header flags). In this paper, we present a framework that allows researchers to more
                     easily test and fuzz any device (i.e., access points and clients). This framework
                     enables one to, for example, test hypothesis on new weaknesses, implement proof-of-concepts,
                     create testing suites, and automate experiments. Our framework is implemented on top
                     of the <em>hostap</em> user space daemon, and includes a language in which complex test cases can be defined
                     (e.g., instructions to inject a sequence of user-modified frames into the network).
                     Notably, a test case can make use of the <em>hostap</em> control interface, providing access to built-in features (e.g., authentication procedures,
                     retrieval of encryption keys) and allows users to create customized <em>hostap</em> extensions.</p>

                  <p>Apple's file-sharing service AirDrop leaks phone numbers and email addresses by exchanging
                     vulnerable hash values of the user's own contact identifiers during the authentication
                     handshake with nearby devices. In a paper presented at USENIX Security'21, we theoretically
                     describe two attacks to exploit these vulnerabilities and propose "PrivateDrop" as
                     a privacy-preserving drop-in replacement for Apple's AirDrop protocol based on private
                     set intersection.</p> 
                  <p>In this demo, we show how these vulnerabilities are efficiently exploitable via Wi-Fi
                     and physical proximity to a target. Privacy and security implications include the
                     possibility of conducting advanced spear phishing attacks or deploying multiple "collector"
                     devices in order to build databases that map contact identifiers to specific locations.
                     For our proof-of-concept, we leverage a custom rainbow table construction to reverse
                     SHA-256 hashes of phone numbers in a matter of milliseconds. We discuss the trade-off
                     between success rate and storage requirements of the rainbow table and, after following
                     responsible disclosure with Apple, we publish our proof-of-concept implementation
                     as "AirCollect" on GitHub.</p>

                  <p>CSI (Channel State Information) of WiFi systems contains the environment channel response
                     between the transmitter and the receiver, so the people/objects and their movement
                     in between can be sensed. To get CSI, the receiver performs channel estimation based
                     on the pre-known training field of the transmitted WiFi signal. CSI related technology
                     is useful in many cases, but it also brings concerns on privacy and security. In this
                     paper, we open sourced a CSI fuzzer to enhance the privacy and security of WiFi CSI
                     applications. It is built and embedded into the transmitter of openwifi, which is
                     an open source full-stack WiFi chip design, to prevent unauthorized sensing without
                     sacrificing the WiFi link performance. The CSI fuzzer imposes an artificial channel
                     response to the signal before it is transmitted, so the CSI seen by the receiver will
                     indicate the actual channel response combined with the artificial response. Only the
                     authorized receiver, that knows the artificial response, can calculate the actual
                     channel response and perform the CSI sensing. Another potential application of the
                     CSI fuzzer is covert channels based on a set of pre-defined artificial response patterns.
                     Our work resolves the pain point of implementing the anti-sensing idea based on the
                     commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices.</p>

                  <p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) are ubiquitously relied upon for positioning
                     and timing. Detection and prevention of attacks against GNSS have been researched
                     over the last decades, but many of these attacks and countermeasures were evaluated
                     based on simulation. This work contributes to the experimental investigation of GNSS
                     vulnerabilities, implementing a relay/replay attack with off-the-shelf hardware. Operating
                     at the signal level, this attack type is not hindered by cryptographically protected
                     transmissions, such as Galileo's Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OS-NMA).
                     The attack we investigate involves two colluding adversaries, relaying signals over
                     large distances, to effectively spoof a GNSS receiver. We demonstrate the attack using
                     off-the-shelf hardware, we investigate the requirements for such successful colluding
                     attacks, and how they can be enhanced, e.g., allowing for finer adversarial control
                     over the victim receiver.</p>

                     pivoting attacks. The main objective of these attacks is to divert the transceivers

                     through another protocol, taking advantage of some similarities in their modulation

                     5.0 specification. To our knowledge, this attack has not been explored so far in the

                  <p>To mitigate spoofing attacks targeting global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)
                     receivers, one promising method is to rely on alternative time sources, such as network-based
                     synchronization, in order to detect clock offset discrepancies caused by GNSS attacks.
                     However, in case of no network connectivity, such validation references would not
                     be available. A viable option is to rely on a local time reference; in particular,
                     precision hardware clock ensembles of chip-scale thermally stable oscillators with
                     extended holdover capabilities. We present a preliminary design and results towards
                     a custom device capable of providing a stable reference, with smaller footprint and
                     cost compared to traditional precision clocks. The system is fully compatible with
                     existing receiver architecture, making this solution feasible for most industrial
                     scenarios. Further integration with network-based synchronization can provide a complete
                     time assurance system, with high short- and long-term stability.</p>

                  <p>Across different Wi-Fi devices, there exist differences in the probing behavior during
                     active scanning. We conjecture that the behavior is sufficiently distinct to identify
                     individual device types. We propose a feature engineering strategy to training machine
                     learning algorithms for determination of the device type. We propose a concurrent
                     capture across multiple Wi-Fi channels, thus allowing the features to include attributes
                     for the transitions happening between channels during active scanning. Small-scale
                     proof-of-concept results provide encouraging results about the method's potential.</p>

                  <p>Minute hardware imperfections in the radio-frequency circuitry of a wireless device
                     can be leveraged as a unique fingerprint. Radio fingerprinting is a way of distinguishing
                     a device from others of the same type at the physical layer by utilizing these hardware
                     imperfections. Recent studies proposed to utilize deep learning over raw I/Q data
                     for the purpose of radio fingerprinting and achieve high accuracy. Unfortunately,
                     deep-learning-based radio finger-printing is not robust over I/Q data across different
                     days due to significant changes in wireless channels. This study proposes to leverage
                     fine-tuning to improve the robustness of radio fingerprinting in a cross-day scenario,
                     where training and test I/Q data are from different days. Our experimental results
                     suggest that transfer learning is a promising approach for robust deep-learning-based
                     radio fingerprinting in practice.</p>
