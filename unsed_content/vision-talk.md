## Security & Privacy Issues of Electric Vehicles and Batteries (May 27) {#mauro}

<br/>

{{< spoiler text="Show abstract">}}
While waiting for Teleportation technologies (which we had insight will
bring its own security and privacy issues), we are still widely using
“traditional” vehicles, which have meanwhile become highly technological
and complex systems, comprising several computing and communication
capabilities for passengers' entertainment, onboard interaction among
vehicle cyber-physical parts, or to interact with passengers' devices
and the road infrastructure. This evolution created multiple attack
surfaces, even further extended by the capabilities and needs of
Electric Vehicles (EVs) and more recent Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer
(DWPT) technologies, allowing for EV charging even while driving.

In this talk, we will survey some of these attacks and countermeasures
(some of which are also shared with other battery-equipped devices),
with a particular focus on threats to EVs and, specifically, DWPT. We
will try to answer questions like the following ones. How can attackers
exploit modern Vehicle-to-Grid communication standards to steal energy?
…and how to avoid being the one paying for such stolen energy? Can
physical charging information of a vehicle allow for its identification
and driver profiling? How can you “trust” your battery? Can we design
automotive communications that are more secure, possibly also in the
post-quantum era?

## Privacy by Birth: Protecting Data from the Source in <br>AIoT Era (May 28){#wenyuan}

<br/>

{{< spoiler text="Show abstract">}}
Sensors play a vital role in artificial intelligence systems, enabling them to gather various data and make informed decisions. However, the proliferation of sensors has led to a surge in collecting data with sensitive user information, e.g., facial or voice biometric information that could lead to human re-identification. Various methods have been proposed to remove such sensitive information,  e.g., face obfuscation or voice conversion. Nevertheless, such anonymization methods are carried out after raw data is collected and processed, and privacy could still be bleached before they reach the anonymization software. To eliminate such threats, we propose a proactive approach to privacy protection, which we call "data privacy by birth." The basic idea is to remove sensitive biometric information inside sensors. Thus, sensors output data that contains almost no user biometric information while sufficing the application. We will discuss the challenges of implementing "privacy by birth” with resource-constrained sensors and present two case studies.

## Quo Vadis Bluetooth? Security by Transparency (May 29){#nils}

<br/>

{{< spoiler text="Show abstract">}}
Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE have become ubiquitous in recent
years, and became a de-facto standard for interactions with personal IoT
devices. Bluetooth even formed the basis for novel applications such as
contact tracing in pandemics, and Apple's AirTag ecosystem. Given those
applications, one would expect Bluetooth's security to be sufficiently
strong. Unfortunately, numerous attacks have been found on all aspects
of the protocol in recent years. Because significant parts of the
Bluetooth controller is not available as open source, and instead only
the 3000+ pages standard document, security analysis is generally
requiring significant (reverse) engineering effort. In this vision talk,
we will briefly summarize core issues in Bluetooth security, how they
relate to the standardization process, and how I would propose to
improve future security in the Bluetooth standard.

Nils Tippenhauer is a faculty at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for
Information Security in Germany. Until 2018, Nils was an Assistant
Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).
He earned his Dr. Sc. in Computer Science from ETH Zurich (Switzerland)
in 2012.

Nils is interested in information security aspects of practical systems.
In particular, his group is currently working on security of embedded
systems and industrial communication protocols in the context of
industrial control systems and the Industrial Internet of Things. At
SUTD, he was involved in the construction and operation of several
practical testbeds in those areas (SWaT, WADI, EPIC). In addition, Nils
worked on physical layer security aspects of wireless and embedded
systems, for example secure ranging, distance measurements and
communication using wireless signals
