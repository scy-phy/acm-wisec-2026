# Terms and Conditions

## General

The following terms and conditions set out the legal rules applicable to the registration for and the participation in conferences, conventions and similar events (“Event”) of the Johannes Kepler University (“JKU”) offered via the JKU-Webshop. The participant shall be bound by these terms and conditions upon registering for the Event. The organizer will not accept any conditions contradictory to or deviant from these General Terms and Conditions.


## Organizer and contract partner

Organizer and therefore contract partner is/are the organisational unit/s named as organizer of the Event.


## Participation, registration

For participation in an Event the prior registration via Webshop is required. By registration for an Event in the Webshop the participant submits a binding offer for the conclusion of a contract. However the contract with the participant is only concluded upon acceptance of the registration by the organizer of the Event. Mere confirmation of receipt of registration does not represent such acceptance of the offer (registration).

The limitation on the number of participants as determined for the relevant Event shall apply.

Journeys to the Event and accommodation are to be arranged personally by the participant. Costs such
as for travel, accomodation, meal or subsistence expenses may result in additional expenses and are
not covered by the Organizer.


## Fees and payment conditions

The participation fee and the included products and/or services are respectively determined for the Event. Reduction of participation fees – as far as foreseen for the Event – is only possible if the relevant requirements are fulfilled.

The participant may only take part in the Event if the participation fees are paid.

Other costs as travel, meal or subsistence expenses and costs for accommodation are excluded from participation fees and result in additional expenses. Journeys to the Event and accommodation are to be arranged personally by the participant.

Payments should be in advance and in Euro only within the deadline for payment using the payment method as foreseen for the Event. In case of late payment interest at the legal rate will be charged.
The first payment reminder is free of charge. For the second reminder administration and reminder costs of € 10,00 and for the third and last reminder administration and reminder costs of € 25,00 will be charged.


## Right of withdrawal for consumers

In case of registration for the Event via telephone, fax, e-mail or internet (distance selling) and
in case the contract is a consumer business in terms of the Austrian Consumers Protection Act the
participant has according to the provisions of the Fern- und Auswärtsgeschäfte-Gesetz (FAGG) the
legal right to withdraw from the contract within 14 days from conclusion of the contract without
giving reasons (§§ 11 ff FAGG). In order to exercise the right to withdraw, the participant has to
inform the Organizer about his/her decision on withdrawal from the contract by an unequivocal
statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). The participant may therefor use the provided
withdrawal form, which however is not obligatory. Further information on the exercise of the right
of withdrawal is available in the registration system under the heading "{{<link href="https://konferenzen.jku.at/wisec2020/withdrawal" target="_blank" >}}Information regarding withdrawal{{</link>}}".

The deadline for exercising the right of withdrawal shall be deemed to have been met if the
communication concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal is sent before the withdrawal period
has expired. In the event that the participant so withdraws from the contract, the Organizer shall
without undue delay and in any event no later than 14 days after receipt of the withdrawal declaration,
reimburse all payments received from the participant. Reimbursement of the payments will be carried
out by using the same means of payment as used for the initial transaction. Transfer to the bank
account named by the participant is agreed as alternative means of payment; the participant will not
be charged for with any costs for such transfer.


## Cancellation

A cancellation of registration is only possible as far as provided for the particular Event. The
requirements for such a cancellation especially in respect of cancellation time limits, form of
cancellation, contact for cancellation and fees specified for the particular Event shall apply.
The legal right of withdrawal described above remains unaffected.


## Program modifications/postponements

The Organizer reserves the right to modify as well as shorten or lengthen the content of the program,
change the speakers and the schedule of presentations without any liability or warranty on his part.

The Organizer retains the right to reschedule or cancel the Event and all related products and/or
services because of force majeure or for important reasons. Important reasons are particularly given,
in case of non-reaching of a minimum number of participants or if presenters, speakers or trainers are
prevented.

In case of cancellation of the Event or if the participant cannot participate in the rescheduled Event,
the participant will be reimbursed the registration fee actually paid.
Any liability or claims of reimbursement are – as far as permitted by law – excluded.


## Warranty, liability

The Organizer does not accept any warranty or liability for the relevance, up-to-dateness, correctness
and completeness in respect of event documentation and content.

The Organizer is only liable for damage which is caused by wilful act or gross negligence of the
Organizer himself or his agents or staff. This limitation of liability shall not be applicable to
personal injury.

and must not be duplicated or used commercially without explicit permission of the respecitive
