# Submission Guidelines

## Full, short, and SoK papers

All papers for ACM WiSec 2022 must be submitted electronically through the {{<link title="HotCRP conference management system" target="_blank" href="https://wisec22.hotcrp.com/" />}}. 

Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions must be prepared using the following ACM proceedings
template and must use US Letter page size (215.9 x 279.4 mm / 8.5 x 11 inches):

- {{<link href="cfp/acmart-1.80-wisec2022.zip" >}}ACM proceedings template for LaTeX{{</ link >}}
<!-- - {{< link target="_blank" href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-new-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt" >}}ACM proceedings template on Overleaf{{</ link >}} -->
- {{<link target="_blank" href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" >}}Further information on ACM proceeding templates{{</ link >}}

Full paper submissions must be **at most 10 pages** in double-column ACM format (use document option “sigconf”), excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices and **at most 15 pages overall**. Committee members are not required to read appendices, so papers should be intelligible without them. Short paper submissions must be **at most 6 pages** overall formatted in the same way as full papers. WiSec 2022 also accepts Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. These should be declared in the submission form and prefixed in the title with "SoK". For SoK papers, the same page limits apply as for full papers.
<!-- SoK papers must be **at most 10 pages**, excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices and at most 15 pages overall. All pages must be numbered (use document option “review”). -->

All submitted papers will be evaluated through **double-blind reviewing**, where the identities of the authors
are withheld from the reviewers until all reviews have been completed (use document option "anonymous").
Therefore, an author's name should only occur in references to that author's related work, which should be
referenced in the third person and not overtly distinguishable from the referenced work of others. Author names
for all papers will be revealed to reviewers after completion of the review process, to discourage abuse of the
system.


## Posters and Demos

All posters and demos for ACM WiSec 2022 must be submitted electronically through the {{<link title="HotCRP conference management system" target="_blank" href="https://wisec22posters.hotcrp.com/" />}}.

For posters and demos, authors should submit **an up to 2 pages** extended abstract, following the same guidelines as for regular papers. Demo submissions should include an additional page that describes what the audience will get to see during the conference. You may submit an URL pointing to a preview of what you would like to present with your abstract.

All poster titles must be prefixed with the keyword “POSTER: " and all demo titles must be prefixed with “DEMO: “. Posters and demos do not need to be blind.

## Registration Requirement

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Therefore, **at least one author** of each accepted paper **must register** to the conference **at regular (non-student) rate** (one per paper) by the author registration deadline indicated by the organizers, and present the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one author registration is valid only for one paper.

All accepted posters and demos must be presented at the conference. Therefore, **at least one author** of each accepted poster/demo **must register** to the conference **at student, member, or regular rate** (one per poster/demo) and present the poster/demo. For authors with multiple accepted posters, one author registration is valid only for one poster.
<!-- For authors with multiple accepted papers, one author registration is valid only for one paper. -->

If none of the authors of an accepted paper/poster/demo is registered by the indicated deadline, or the paper/poster/demo is not presented in the conference, it will be withdrawn from the conference proceedings. 
All conference proceedings will be published by ACM.

Registration and attendance fees for ACM WiSec 2022 are yet to be announced. 
<!-- We expect fees in the range of {{<link title="last year's fees" target="_blank" href="https://konferenzen.jku.at/wisec2020/" />}}. 
There will be substantial differences between fees for authors and fees for online participants. Should the cost of author registrations be prohibitive for submitting papers, do reach out to the General Chairs ({{< mailto "wisec2021chairs@nyu.edu" />}}) for a case-by-case consideration in the spirit of an inclusive event. -->


## Camera-ready Submission

Upon acceptance, authors must sign a copyright transfer statement. The contact (lead) author(s) will receive
instructions on how and where to complete their ACM rights management form. As rights management e-mails are
sent from an automated system, there is a chance that e-mails sent will wind up in SPAM folders. Please make
sure that SPAM settings allow e-mails from rightsreview@acm.org. After completing the rights management form,
authors will be e-mailed the correct rights text and bibliographic strip that **MUST** be placed within their
camera-ready paper. Authors **MUST** format the camera-ready version using the provided template (please check
to have not included packages that change the type fonts or layout) and submit both source files plus
camera-ready PDF.

## Double Submissions

It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved.


## Further Information

Submissions not meeting all of the above guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Please direct any questions about the paper submission process to the program chairs.
