## Sensing the Future: Unveiling the Benefits and Risks of Sensing in Cyber-Physical Security {#han}

<br/>

{{< spoiler text="Show abstract">}}
With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPS), we are witnessing a wealth of exciting applications
that enable computational devices to interact with the physical world
via an overwhelming number of sensors and actuators. However, such
interactions pose new challenges to traditional approaches to security
and privacy. In this talk, I will present how I utilize sensor data to
provide security and privacy protections for IoT/CPS scenarios, and
further introduce novel security threats arising from similar sensor
data. Specifically, I will highlight some of our recent projects that
leverage sensor data for attack and defense in various IoT settings. I
will also introduce my future research directions such as identifying
and defending against unforeseen security challenges from newer
domains including smart homes, buildings, and vehicles.

Jun Han is an Associate Professor at KAIST of Computer Science, School
of Computing at KAIST. He founded and directs the Cyber-Physical
Systems and Security (CyPhy) Lab at KAIST. Prior to joining KAIST, he
was at the National University of Singapore with an appointment in the
Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, and Yonsei
University with an appointment in the School of Electrical and
Electronic Engineering. His research interest lies at the intersection
of security and mobile/sensing systems and focuses on utilizing
contextual information to solve security problems in the
Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. He publishes at
top-tier venues across various research communities spanning mobile
computing, sensing systems, and security (including IEEE S&P, USENIX
Security, ACM CCS, MobiSys, MobiCom, SenSys, Ubicomp, IPSN). Jun also
serves on TPC of several top-tier venues in these areas (including
IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, ACM MobiSys, SenSys, IPSN) and received
multiple awards including the Google Research Scholar Award. He
received his Ph.D. from the Electrical and Computer Engineering
Department at Carnegie Mellon University as a member of the Mobile,
Embedded, and Wireless (MEWS) Group. He received his M.S. and B.S.
degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering also at Carnegie Mellon
University. Jun also worked as a software engineer at Samsung
Electronics.
