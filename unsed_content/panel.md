# Panel Discussion

## Wireless and Mobile Security Research and Teaching in the Post-Pandemic World {#panel}

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of our lives at a global scale. This includes the disruption of the research and teaching we perform within the security and privacy community. As the pandemic is weaning off, the lessons learnt during the pandemic can be very valuable in the future, both for navigating pandemic-like situations, and for accommodating greater inclination towards remote work and education. In this panel, international experts with various professional backgrounds and different points of view will discuss the impact they faced over the last two years, such as halting (or starting) specific research problems due to pandemic-related restrictions, unique challenges in deploying new experiments and how they overcame them, and finding novel ways to facilitate social events like conferences and hackathons.
