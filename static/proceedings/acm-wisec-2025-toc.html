                  <p>Telecommunication networks form the backbone of our connected society, enabling global
                     voice and data communication. Yet, beneath their seamless operation lies a complex
                     interplay of signaling protocols, legacy systems, and evolving technologies that have,
                     over the decades, exposed both opportunities for innovation and significant security
                     challenges. While these networks have changed over the past 50 years and complexity
                     has migrated outwards to devices, one enduring challenge has been a lack of accessibility.
                     In this talk, we will discuss some of our recent efforts to better understand functionality
                     on mobile devices by examining command sets [3] and processors [2]. We also look at
                     security assessment techniques and how they can expose vulnerabilities in core cellular
                     infrastructure. A central focus of this talk is the application of fuzz testing-a
                     powerful technique for discovering implementation flaws and specification ambiguities.
                     Fuzzing involves generating random or mutated inputs and injecting them into target
                     systems to observe unusual behaviors or crashes. In the context of telecom networks,
                     a fuzzing campaign can target the message handling logic, permuting fields such as
                     the Protocol Discriminator or Bearer Capabilities, causing ASN.1 decoders in some
                     devices to fail, leading to denial-of-service or potentially more severe consequences
                     [1]. Through case studies and demonstrations, the talk will reveal how seemingly innocuous
                     fields in call setup messages can destabilize network components or user devices,
                     while also examining how the analysis of messages rather than examining device behavior
                     can lead to the detection of rogue elements [4] in a network.</p>

                  <p>As the race to define 6G intensifies, the focus has overwhelmingly centered on maximizing
                     efficiency-whether in cost, spectral utilization, or energy consumption. Yet, resilience
                     and security, the cornerstone attributes for deploying 6G in mission-critical industries
                     such as energy, defense, and healthcare, have been conspicuously absent from the design
                     discourse. This oversight, rooted in legacy approaches to cellular communication,
                     risks undermining 6G's ability to meet the uncompromising demands of applications
                     where reliability and adaptability are non-negotiable. In this keynote, I will redefine
                     resilience in the context of next-generation wireless networks, distinguishing it
                     from related concepts such as robustness and reliability, while highlighting how security
                     is inherently embedded within resilience. I will explore the tension between efficiency,
                     complexity, and resilience, revealing how the relentless pursuit of superior performance
                     has led to overly intricate designs that inadvertently compromise the ability to withstand
                     disruptions. By identifying the structural and systemic traits that characterize truly
                     resilient networks, I will offer a roadmap for how 6G design must evolve to integrate
                     resilience as a foundational principle. Finally, I will introduce practical frameworks
                     for quantifying resilience, equipping researchers and engineers with tools to embed
                     this critical attribute into the DNA of 6G systems. This keynote is a call to action-a
                     rallying cry to rethink the priorities driving 6G innovation. By striking a deliberate
                     balance between efficiency, complexity, and resilience, we can ensure that 6G not
                     only delivers on its promise of performance but also becomes a transformative technology
                     capable of thriving in the most demanding, high-stakes environments.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents <em>WirelessTap,</em> a system that demonstrates the potential for automated speech recognition (ASR) on
                     phone call audio eavesdropped remotely using commercially available frequency modulated
                     continuous wave millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars operating in the 77-81 GHz range.
                     <em>WirelessTap</em> detects minute vibrations from smartphone earpieces, converts them into audio, and
                     processes this audio for speech transcription. This work presents the first full-sentence
                     ASR using mmWave radars on earpiece vibrations using a 10,000-word vocabulary, achieving
                     a 300 cm attack range across multiple smartphone models. It surpasses prior radar-based
                     eavesdropping studies limited to loudspeakers, small vocabularies, or constrained
                     evaluations. To address challenges like the absence of large mmWave radar-based audio
                     datasets, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited voice frequency ranges extractable
                     from radar data, <em>WirelessTap</em> incorporates synthetic data generation, domain adaptation, and inference using OpenAI's
                     Whisper ASR model. Our experiments systematically show how word accuracy rate gradually
                     decreases with distance, from as high as 59.25% at 50 cm to 2% at 300 cm; additionally,
                     we deploy this attack to a real-world setting with a user study targeting a victim
                     holding a smartphone to their ear. This paper highlights the evolving risks of artificial
                     intelligence and sensor systems being misused as technology advances.</p>

                  <p>In run-time attestation schemes, including Control Flow Attestation (<em>CFA</em>) and Data Flow Attestation (<em>DFA</em>), a remote Verifier (<em>V</em>rf) requests a potentially compromised Prover device (<em>P</em>rv) to generate evidence of its execution control flow path (<em>in CFA</em>) and optionally execution data inputs (<em>in DFA</em>). Recent advances in this space also guarantee that <em>V</em>rf eventually receives run-time evidence from <em>P</em>rv, even when <em>P</em>rv is fully compromised. Reliable delivery, in theory, enables run-time auditing in
                     addition to attestation, allowing <em>V</em>rf to examine run-time compromise traces to pinpoint/remediate attack root causes.
                     However, <em>V</em>rf's perspective in this security service remains unexplored, with most prior work
                     focusing on the secure generation of authentic run-time evidence on <em>P</em>rv.</p> 
                  <p>In this work, we argue that run-time attestation/auditing is only effective if <em>V</em>rf can analyze the received evidence. From this premise, we characterize different
                     types of evidence produced by run-time attestation/auditing architectures based on
                     <em>V</em>rf's ability to use them for vulnerability detection/remediation. As a case study,
                     we propose SABRE: a Security Analysis and Binary Repair Engine that enables <em>V</em>rf to use run-time evidence to detect control flow attacks, to pinpoint specific instructions
                     that corrupted control data, and to automatically generate binary patches to buffer
                     overflow and use-after-free vulnerabilities without source code knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, though critical to numerous civilian and
                     industrial applications, remain susceptible to spoofing due to their unencrypted nature.
                     While many existing defenses focus on single-antenna spoofing, multi-antenna spoofing
                     has been theorized as a significantly more potent threat. However, practical realizations
                     of multi-antenna spoofing have been limited by the stringent requirement of nanosecond-level
                     synchronization.</p> 
                  <p>In this paper, we present the first low-cost, end-to-end implementation of a distributed
                     multi-antenna GPS spoofing attack using off-the-shelf devices. We systematically examine
                     the technical prerequisites, establishing sub-50 ns alignment among spoofing signals
                     as the requirement for successfully spoofing standard GPS receivers. Building on this
                     analysis, we design a multi-antenna spoofing system that continuously monitors and
                     adaptively adjusts relative signal timing, mitigating hardware imperfections and oscillator
                     drift in real time. Our prototype, built using HackRFs and Raspberry Pis, demonstrates
                     that it can successfully spoof devices such as Android phones and commercial GPS receivers.
                     Through controlled experiments in an anechoic chamber, we show that our attack can
                     steer these receivers to falsified locations with an average error of 30~m, while
                     also evading detection by robust angle-of-arrival-based systems. Finally, we discuss
                     practical considerations for wide-area deployments, along with countermeasures that
                     may mitigate this emerging threat.</p>

                  <p>This paper analyzes the Embedded SIM card's Machine-to-Machine Remote Provisioning
                     Protocol's (eSIM M2M RSP) design. The eSIM M2M RSP simplifies 5G connectivity for
                     IoT devices by securely delivering connection bootstrapping information over the air
                     without human intervention. As IoT adoption with 5G connectivity surges, the eSIM
                     infrastructure must handle a growing number of concurrent remote SIM provisioning
                     requests. The statefulness and shared states of the RSP make it challenging and error-prone
                     to implement concurrency without data races. The GSMA eSIM standard does not explicitly
                     define any atomicity assumptions required for concurrent execution. A formal analysis
                     of the standard-prescribed M2M RSP design reveals that explicit atomicity assumptions
                     are necessary; without them, 31 data races can violate key invariants. During the
                     responsible disclosure process, discussions with the standards body revealed that
                     the M2M RSP design relies on unstated and implicit atomicity assumptions. However,
                     we find that the standard prescribed implicit assumptions are not strong enough to
                     maintain all the invariants. The identified race conditions can be exploited by third-party
                     eSIM management platforms to defraud network operators. To mitigate these risks, we
                     developed a fine-grained synchronization mechanism that we formally verified for correctness
                     and empirically evaluated for performance. Empirical evaluations show that our synchronization
                     mechanism ensures correctness while outperforming a baseline with a 6× speed up.</p>

                  <p>The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the telecommunications
                     industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity, and rapid innovation. However,
                     its disaggregated architecture introduces complex testing challenges, particularly
                     in validating multi-vendor components against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications.
                     Existing frameworks, such as those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres
                     (OTICs), rely heavily on manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error,
                     leading to inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we
                     present AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to automate the
                     validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative Large Language Models
                     (LLM) framework consisting of <em>Gen-LLM,</em> <em>Val-LLM,</em> and <em>Debug-LLM.</em> Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test cases based on
                     3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references signaling messages against
                     these flows to validate compliance and detect deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM
                     performs root cause analysis, providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency
                     and trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
                     Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for approval
                     before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test cases obtained
                     from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest demonstrates a significant
                     reduction in overall test execution time compared to traditional manual methods, while
                     maintaining high validation accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Privacy is a fundamental right concerned with the protection and control of personal
                     and sensitive information. A common threat to user privacy is the monitoring and tracking
                     of individuals during web browsing without their consent. A common technique used
                     for this purpose is browser fingerprinting, which exploits characteristics of a user's
                     device to create a unique identifier. Traditionally, software-based fingerprints have
                     been used for this purpose. Recently, hardware-based fingerprinting has gained attention
                     due to its resilience to privacy-enhancing technologies. WebGPU is a modern JavaScript
                     API that enables webpages to efficiently utilize a device's Graphics Processing Unit
                     (GPU) for general-purpose computation. This paper focuses on the impact of WebGPU
                     on hardware-based fingerprinting. We show that by using this web API, the execution
                     behaviour of a device's GPU can be characterized to reidentify the device while evading
                     privacy mechanisms. We introduce <em>AtomicIncrement,</em> a novel fingerprinting approach based on the scheduling behaviour of compute shaders
                     which is usable within WebGPU with both high accuracy and low computational impact.
                     In our evaluation, a classifier can reidentify a device with an accuracy of 70% from
                     a pool of 500 devices using AtomicIncrement fingerprints, highlighting the privacy
                     threat of WebGPU-based fingerprinting for modern web browsing. A robustness analysis
                     with over 2 million fingerprints shows that the accuracy remains stable under various
                     device conditions.</p>

                  <p>In-flight Wi-Fi provides high-speed Internet connectivity to travelers at 30,000 feet
                     at premium fees. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of the <em>architecture and security policies</em> of in-flight Wi-Fi paywall systems using <em>network tomography</em> analysis. We discover that attackers can exploit the inherent architectural shortcomings
                     of airborne networks to create covert channels and conceal data packets within certain
                     ''always-allowed'' traffic for free Internet access. Moreover, broken device authentication
                     policies in these systems allow unlimited complimentary Internet connectivity. Finally,
                     insecure ARP policies allow attackers to steal paid users' bandwidth to access the
                     free Internet even faster. We validate these issues in practice over two major in-flight
                     Wi-Fi providers using common protocols, e.g., UDP, DNS, etc. We also find that the

                     of these systems and propose countermeasures to address these flaws and prevent similar

                  <p>Location-based service (LBS) applications proliferate and support transportation,
                     entertainment, and more. Modern mobile platforms, with smartphones being a prominent
                     example, rely on terrestrial and satellite infrastructures (e.g., global navigation
                     satellite system (GNSS) and crowdsourced Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and IP databases)
                     for correct positioning. However, they are vulnerable to attacks that manipulate positions
                     to control and undermine LBS functionality-thus enabling the scamming of users or
                     services. Our work reveals that GNSS spoofing attacks succeed even though smartphones
                     have multiple sources of positioning information. Moreover, that Wi-Fi spoofing attacks
                     with GNSS jamming are surprisingly effective. More concerning is the evidence that
                     sophisticated, coordinated spoofing attacks are highly effective. Attacks can target
                     GNSS in combination with other positioning methods, thus defenses that assume that
                     only GNSS is under attack cannot be effective. More so, resilient GNSS receivers and
                     special-purpose antennas are not feasible on smartphones. To address this gap, we
                     propose an extended receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) framework that
                     leverages the readily available, redundant, often so-called opportunistic positioning
                     information on off-the-shelf platforms. We jointly use onboard sensors, terrestrial
                     infrastructures, and GNSS. We show that our extended RAIM framework improves resilience
                     against location spoofing, e.g., achieving a detection accuracy improvement of up
                     to 24-58% compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms and location providers; detecting
                     attacks within 5 seconds, with a low false positive rate.</p>

                  <p>This work investigates how to monitor access to Android zero-permission sensors which
                     could cause privacy leakage to users. Moreover, monitoring such sensitive access allows
                     security researchers to characterize potential sensor abuse patterns. Zero-permission
                     sensors such as accelerometers have become an indispensable part of Android devices.
                     The critical information they provide has attracted extensive research investigating
                     how data collectors could capture more sensor data to enable both benign and exploitative
                     applications. In contrast, little work has explored how to enable data providers,
                     such as end users, to understand sensor usage. While existing methods such as static
                     analysis and hooking-based dynamic analysis face challenges of requiring complicated
                     development chains, rooting privilege, and app-specific reverse engineering analysis,
                     our work aims to bridge this gap by developing ARMOUR for user-space runtime monitoring,
                     leveraging the intrinsic sampling rate variation and convergence behaviors of Android.
                     ARMOUR enables privacy-aware users to easily monitor how third-party apps use sensor
                     data and support security researchers to perform rapid app-agnostic sensor access
                     analysis. Our evaluation with 1,448 commercial applications shows the effectiveness
                     of ARMOUR in detecting sensor usage in obfuscated code and other conditions, and observes
                     salient sensor abuse patterns such as 50% of apps from seemingly sensor-independent
                     categories accessing data of multiple zero-permission sensors. We analyze the impact

                  <p>IMSI catchers are surveillance tools that intercept cellular signals to capture user
                     identifiers, such as the IMSI. By imitating a legitimate BS and compelling phones
                     to connect via jamming or stronger signal, they cause temporary disconnection, risking
                     service disruption and raising suspicion, which limits their covert effectiveness.
                     This paper presents FlashCatch, an IMSI-catching approach that significantly accelerates
                     the two primary factors leading to service disruption. First, by exploiting 3GPP standard
                     vulnerabilities, FlashCatch reduces IMSI capture time by over 200 times. Second, it
                     improves the detachment phase through intentional authentication failures, inducing
                     a rapid switch back to a legitimate cell and barring the FBS cell from further reconnection,
                     thus reducing overall noticeable service disruption by at least 50-fold. Laboratory
                     experiments on 7 devices featuring basebands from three different manufacturers demonstrate
                     sub-second IMSI retrieval with seamless service continuity, while dedicated VoLTE
                     and VoIP experiments confirm that ongoing calls resume without termination after a
                     transient small disruption. In-the-wild field tests with 50 volunteers further validate
                     its stealth and operational effectiveness. Moreover, FlashCatch preserves the UE's
                     security context, retaining temporary identifiers that enable linkability attacks
                     for subsequent tracking.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, we have witnessed a remarkable proliferation of Internet of Things
                     (IoT) devices, which are quickly penetrating into almost every industry and making
                     tremendous impacts on the national economy and the entire society. However, security
                     and privacy remain a fundamental hurdle in the collection, transmission, and processing
                     of IoT data. This work focuses on privacy-preserved data access that is critical for
                     implementing and exploiting the full potential of future IoT. This work represents
                     the first endeavor to develop practical Compact Inner Product Encryption (C-IPE) aiming
                     to achieve privacy-preserved data access in IoTs. We propose a practical scheme that
                     provides <em>effective, fine-grained, and privacy-preserved access</em> to IoT data while at the same time, is <em>computationally efficient</em> for practical deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices to preserve the designers
                     of energy-efficient embedded systems and applications a balance between performance,
                     power, security, and cost-effectiveness. We also analyze the efficiency of C-IPE.
                     Compared with the original IPE, the key size is reduced from <em>n</em> + 1 to a small constant; the ciphertext size is reduced by half, i.e., from 2<em>n</em> + 2 to <em>n</em> + 1; and the decryption effectively avoids the high cost of cryptographic pairing.
                     These salient properties result in high efficiency in computation and storage, making
                     C-IPE well-suited for IoT applications. To demonstrate the practicality of our scheme,
                     we implement C-IPE in three representative privacy-preserving applications: privacy-preserved
                     attribute matching, distance matching, and linear regression in IoT settings. We carry
                     out extensive experiments on four platforms, i.e., Dell workstation, Raspberry Pi
                     3 with an ARM Cortex processor, Samsung Galaxy 7, and ultra-low-power Arduino Nano
                     33 micro-controller using 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 CPU with 256KB Flash and 16KB RAM.
                     The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing IPE schemes,

                  <p>Signal injection attacks pose a serious threat to systems that rely on sensor information
                     to determine their behavior. Using such an attack, an attacker can remotely manipulate
                     the values of a sensor by transmitting appropriately formed RF signals that induce
                     a current in the sensor wires. For example, to manipulate the temperature sensor in
                     a battery management system, to trigger thermal protection, and shut down the battery.
                     While several defense mechanisms have been proposed, they all need additional hardware
                     to work. In this paper, we present RIPPLE, a fully software-based detection mechanism
                     that can reliably detect signal injection attacks against drone sensor systems. A
                     software-only solution is a practical way to add protection to an existing fleet of
                     drones, and it is a cost effective alternative to the existing proposals for new drones.
                     Our detection mechanism exploits a physical layer property known as small-scale (fast)
                     fading, which causes the wireless channel between the attacker and drone to change
                     unpredictably. As a result, the power induced by the attacker's transmission will
                     oscillate rapidly, whenever the drone is in motion. We show for the first time that
                     this effect occurs even with extremely minimal motion, such as a drone hovering in
                     place on a calm, windless day. This oscillation is used as the basis of our detection
                     system. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of RIPPLE on drones in several different
                     environments. Our results show that RIPPLE reliably detects signal injection attacks.
                     Even for weak attacks, changing the temperature by as little as 2°C, and with a drone
                     movement of only a few millimeters, we have a success rate of over 98%. The performance
                     only improves with stronger attack signals or more movement.</p>

                  <p>Motivated by the growing prevalence of increasingly advanced satellite jamming attacks,
                     we introduce and systematically analyze protocol-aware jammers: the worst-case scenario
                     that maximally exploits the protocol to deny service whilst remaining as difficult
                     to detect as possible. This extends existing satellite jamming and anti-jamming literature,
                     which to date considers only conventional jamming waveforms. We find that protocol-aware
                     jammers are significantly more effective than conventional jammers against all major
                     standardized satellite protocols, including when anti-jamming countermeasures in the
                     form of interleaving and adaptive coding and modulation are employed. This performance
                     is possible since current protocols have a cyclic and predictable nature. We assess
                     the required capabilities in terms of synchronization, and show that many of these
                     performance gains can be realized even by completely desynchronized jammers. We experimentally
                     evaluate protocol-aware strategies against both a hardware and software receiver.
                     The results show that over 15dB of performance gains over Gaussian jamming are possible
                     against all tested satellite protocols. Furthermore, we find that the attack can be
                     optimized in simulation and deployed against the hardware receiver without performance
                     degradation. We conclude with a discussion of countermeasures, primarily at the protocol
                     level, to improve the availability of these systems.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of millimeter-wave radar sensing technology has given rise to
                     a proliferation of open-source radar datasets, creating an urgent need for innovative
                     digital copyright protection techniques. However, conventional image and audio watermarking
                     techniques are inadequate for radar copyright protection due to radar signals' sparsity,
                     vulnerability and complexity. In this paper, we present RFinger, an ownership verification
                     framework for static indoor millimeter-wave radar datasets. Our approach encodes environmental
                     information extracted from radar signals into digital watermarks, strategically embedding
                     these within carefully selected data frames to establish robust verification credentials.
                     We develop statistical hypothesis testing metrics to detect unauthorized access to
                     RFinger-protected data in black-box setting. Our strategic watermark design ensures
                     that the unauthorized models exhibit distinctly anomalous performance on verification
                     data compared to legitimate models. Through experiments on two large millimeter-wave
                     radar datasets, we have validated that our designed strategy provides high watermark
                     retrieval accuracy without compromising downstream tasks.</p>

                  <p>Many computing systems need to be protected against physical attacks using active
                     tamper detection based on sensors. One technical solution is to employ an Anti-Tamper
                     Radio (ATR) approach, analyzing the radio wave propagation effects within a protected
                     device to detect unauthorized physical alterations. However, ATR systems face key
                     challenges in terms of susceptibility to signal manipulation attacks, limited reliability
                     due to environmental noise, and regulatory constraints from wide bandwidth usage.</p> 
                  <p>In this work, we propose and experimentally evaluate an ATR system complemented by
                     a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to dynamically reconfigure the wireless
                     propagation environment. We show that this approach can enhance resistance against
                     signal manipulation attacks, reduce bandwidth requirements from several GHz down to
                     as low as 20 MHz, and improve robustness to environmental disturbances such as internal
                     fan movements.</p> 
                  <p>Our work demonstrates that RIS integration can strengthen the ATR performance to enhance
                     security, sensitivity, and robustness, recognizing the potential of smart radio environments

                  <p>Ensuring user privacy remains a critical concern within mobile cellular networks,
                     particularly given the proliferation of interconnected devices and services. In fact,
                     a lot of user privacy issues have been raised in 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. Acknowledging
                     these concerns, 3GPP has prioritized addressing these issues in the development of
                     5G, implementing numerous modifications to enhance user privacy since 5G Release 15.
                     In this systematization of knowledge paper, we first provide a framework for studying
                     privacy and security related attacks in cellular networks, setting as privacy objective
                     the User Identity Confidentiality defined in 3GPP standards. Using this framework,
                     we discuss existing privacy and security attacks in pre-5G networks, analyzing the
                     weaknesses that lead to these attacks. Furthermore, we thoroughly study the security

                     mechanisms of 5G to the identified pre-5G attacks. Afterwards, we analyze how recent

                     to frame fragmentation and aggregation, also known as the FragAttacks. In this paper,

                  <p>As 5G and future generations of mobile networks aim to provide faster and more secure
                     wireless connections, 5G broadcast messages remain unprotected. Hence, a user device
                     cannot verify the identity of a base station before establishing the connection and
                     starting the registration procedure. This long-existing loophole enables various types
                     of fake base station (FBS) attacks. To protect end-users from these attacks, a practical
                     solution is to introduce a digital signature for these broadcast messages. However,
                     an FBS may also have the ability to relay a digitally signed broadcast message from
                     a benign base station to bypass the protection. Considering that a relayed message
                     needs extra time to reach a user device, a time-bounded defense mechanism can be used
                     on top of the digital signature to offer replay protection. Although previous work
                     proposed such a solution, none have implemented it or evaluated it against relay attacks.
                     Hence, to evaluate the performance of our proposed digital signature scheme and the
                     time-bounded defense, we implemented the solution against relay attacks using an open-source
                     5G system. Our results show that the overhead introduced is acceptable and that the
                     time-bounded defense is effective against relay attacks.</p>

                  <p>Cellular baseband processors represent critical security components in modern mobile
                     devices, yet they remain challenging to analyze due to their complexity and restricted
                     access. Recent advances in baseband research introduced FirmWire, the state-of-the-art
                     emulator enabling full-system baseband emulation with extensive features debugging
                     capabilities. However, it lacks protocol state awareness, significantly limiting its
                     coverage and fidenlity. While implementing such support demands substantial engineering
                     effort, accurately modeling protocol states remains essential for comprehensive baseband
                     security analysis. In this paper, we present FirmState, a state-aware methodology that augments baseband emulation, specifically targeting
                     Samsung Shannon baseband. FirmState semi-automatically recovers and applies state information extracted from physical
                     devices during actual network communication, enabling more complete code coverage
                     and authentic behavior reproduction without extensive reverse engineering. Our evaluation
                     demonstrates a significant improvement in code coverage, achieving 7.5% for RRC--2.7×
                     higher than previous work. Additionally, our system newly supports NAS over FirmWire,
                     with code coverage ranging from 4.5% to 9.2%, depending on the protocol state. Using
                     our approach, we discovered and analyzed two 1-day vulnerabilities in Samsung's baseband
                     implementation, demonstrating FirmState's effectiveness for baseband security. We make FirmState open-source to support further research in baseband security.</p>

                  <p>Prior security analyses of 3GPP systems primarily focus on upper layers of the stack.
                     Unfortunately, the physical and MAC layers are not as thoroughly analyzed, even though
                     they are neither encrypted nor integrity protected. Furthermore, the latest 5G releases
                     significantly increase the number of low-layer control messages and procedures. We
                     conduct a systematic vulnerability analysis of these low layers, and demonstrate that
                     current cellular systems are susceptible to passive attacks, and active spoofing of
                     PHY/MAC messages. For instance, we find that sniffing beamforming information enables
                     fingerprinting-based localization and tracking of users. We also show that signal
                     spoofing is possible in 5G NR, and more efficient compared to LTE networks. We also
                     evaluate active attacks against COTS UEs, showing it is possible to disrupt user communications
                     by tricking connected UEs into acting as jammers, or by stealthily disconnecting active
                     users. In our experiments we achieve user localization within 20-meters 96% of the
                     time, user path tracking within 15 meters for 81% of the paths, and throughput reduction
                     by over 95% within 2 seconds (by spoofing a 39-bit DCI).</p>

                  <p>LoRaWAN has become a widely adopted, cost-effective solution for Low-Power Wide-Area
                     Networks (LPWANs), bridging the gap between short-range wireless protocols and high-power
                     cellular networks. Its affordable hardware and robust physical layer make it a key
                     enabler for Internet of Things (IoT) applications across sectors like agriculture,
                     smart cities, and industrial automation-domains where security is of central importance.
                     In this paper, we present BlindSpot, a novel jamming attack that enables efficient
                     selective jamming of LoRaWAN gateways. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
                     creating high-power interference, BlindSpot exploits the limited number of demodulation
                     paths in LoRaWAN gateways to continuously occupy the gateways with fabricated frames,
                     blinding them for any other legitimate transmissions. Compared to existing approaches,
                     this reduces the attacker's power requirements and allows them to decode the legitimate
                     transmissions with a high probability. Selectively retransmitting these frames, the
                     attacker has precise control over which transmissions can be decoded by the gateway.
                     Using a Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based LoRa transceiver, we demonstrate the effectiveness
                     of the attack against commercial LoRaWAN gateways and propose detection and mitigation
                     strategies to improve the security of LoRaWAN deployments.</p>

                     and critical infrastructure scenarios. One key feature of 5G, ultra-reliable low latency
                     communication, is particularly appealing to such scenarios for its real-time capabilities.
                     However, 5G's enhanced security, mostly realized through <em>optional</em> security controls, imposes additional overhead on the network performance, potentially
                     hindering its real-time capabilities. To better assess this impact and guide operators
                     in choosing between different options, we measure the latency overhead of IPsec when
                     applied over the N3 and the service based interfaces to protect user and control plane
                     data, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate whether WireGuard constitutes an alternative

                     commercial aviation, independent local- ization methods such as ground-based distributed
                     multilateration are increasingly being adopted for enhanced safety. While previous
                     work has suggested these systems may be susceptible to multi- device spoofing, no
                     successful real-world multilateration spoofing attacks have been documented so far.
                     In this study, we examined the feasibility and potential impact of wireless spoofing

                     sensitive edge data. Secure aggregation protocols enhance privacy in FL by ensuring

                  <p>The proliferation of propaganda on mobile platforms raises critical concerns around
                     detection accuracy and user privacy. To address this, we propose TRIDENT -a <em>three-tier propaganda detection model implementing transformers, adversarial learning,
                        and differential privacy</em> which integrates syntactic obfuscation and label perturbation to mitigate privacy
                     leakage while maintaining propaganda detection accuracy. TRIDENT leverages multilingual
                     back-translation to introduce semantic variance, character-level noise, and entity
                     obfuscation for differential privacy enforcement, and combines these techniques into
                     a unified defense mechanism. Using a binary propaganda classification dataset, baseline
                     transformer models (BERT, GPT-2) we achieved F1 scores of 0.89 and 0.90. Applying
                     TRIDENT's third-tier defense yields a reduced but effective cumulative F1 of 0.83,

                  <p>SIM tracing - the ability to inspect, modify, and relay communication between a SIM
                     card and modem - has become a significant technique in cellular network research.
                     It enables essential security- and development-related applications such as fuzzing
                     communication interfaces, extracting session keys, monitoring hidden SIM activity
                     (e.g., proactive SIM commands or over-the-air updates), and facilitating scalable,
                     distributed measurement platforms through SIM reuse. Traditionally, achieving these
                     capabilities has relied on specialized hardware, which can pose financial and logistical
                     burdens for researchers, particularly those new to the field.</p> 
                  <p>In this work, we show that full SIM tracing functionality can be achieved using only
                     simple, widely available components, such as UART interfaces and GPIO ports. We port
                     these capabilities to low-cost microcontrollers, exemplified by the Raspberry Pi Pico
                     (4 USD). Unlike other approaches, it dramatically reduces hardware complexity by electrically
                     decoupling the SIM and the modem and only transferring on APDU level.</p> 
                  <p>By significantly reducing hardware requirements and associated costs, we aim to make
                     SIM tracing techniques accessible to a broader community of researchers and hobbyists,
                     fostering wider exploration and experimentation in cellular network research.</p>

                  <p>The rapid expansion of wireless IoT devices in domains such as smart homes, healthcare,
                     and critical infrastructure has heightened concerns about data privacy, especially
                     as many devices continue to access cloud services without encryption. Private Information
                     Retrieval (PIR) protocols offer a way to protect query privacy by hiding the accessed
                     record index, but most existing approaches rely on computationally intensive operations
                     that exceed the capabilities of low-power IoT hardware. We present <em>VeilPIR</em>, a lightweight single-server PIR protocol designed specifically for resource-constrained
                     devices connected over wireless links like BLE and Wi-Fi. VeilPIR shifts the heavy
                     cryptographic workload to the server, allowing clients to send small encrypted queries
                     and receive constant-size responses that preserve semantic privacy. We implemented
                     VeilPIR in Python using Flask and deployed it to simulate realistic IoT conditions.
                     Evaluation on a client and a cloud server shows 900 ms round-trip for 1,000 records
                     and &lt;1 J energy per query, while still allowing live record insertions and deletions
                     without full re-encryption.</p>

                  <p>Smishing, or SMS-based phishing, poses an increasing threat to mobile users by mimicking
                     legitimate communications through culturally adapted, concise, and deceptive messages,
                     which can result in the loss of sensitive data or financial resources. In such, we

                  <p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is increasingly prevalent in IoT networks, particularly
                     in high-risk environments such as medical IoT. However, existing security research
                     in BLE often focuses on isolated device types or controlled environments, overlooking
                     the complexities of real-world BLE interactions, including environmental noise and
                     the heterogeneous nature of devices. This paper proposes a multilayered framework
                     for BLE data extraction designed to capture, process, and correlate data from diverse
                     sources to construct comprehensive behavioral signatures. Our approach explores traffic
                     analysis and introduces the potential of spectrum analysis to identify malicious activity
                     beyond conventional packet-level monitoring. By identifying key behavioral markers
                     and deviations from expected norms, this approach enhances BLE anomaly detection and
                     strengthens the security of IoT networks.</p>

                  <p>A Diameter firewall is essential for mobile operators to protect their subscribers,
                     as Diameter networks lack end-to-end authentication and heavily rely on trust among
                     partner operators. Among the various attacks exploiting the Diameter protocol, one
                     notable example involves falsely updating a subscriber's location and illegitimately
                     requesting authentication data. Conventional methods, known as velocity checks, validate
                     the originating network of messages by assessing the plausibility of subscriber movement
                     based solely on network-provided information. However, attackers can still bypass

                  <p>The transition to Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) introduces testing challenges
                     due to multi-vendor interoperability requirements, with existing manual frameworks
                     being error-prone and unscalable. To address this, we propose AI5GTest, an AI-driven

                     Networks (LPWANs), bridging the gap between short-range wireless protocols and high-power
                     cellular networks. Its affordable hardware and robust physical layer make it a key

                     smart cities, and industrial automation-domains where security is of central importance.
                     Investigating LoRaWAN's resilience against physical-layer attacks, we developed <em>BlindSpot,</em> a novel jamming attack targeting state-of-the-art LoRaWAN gateways. Unlike traditional
                     jammers, BlindSpot does not rely on overpowering transmissions but prevents their
                     reception by exhausting resources at the gateway. This is possible since commercial
                     gateway processors have only a limited number of demodulators for parallel frame reception.
                     In this demo, we show the effectiveness of the attack against a commercial LoRaWAN
                     gateway, compare it to traditional jamming, and show how our Software-Defined Radio

                  <p>Wireless eavesdropping on phone conversations has become a major security concern
                     as attackers repurpose advanced wireless capabilities in 5G and beyond featuring higher
                     frequencies and higher sensing resolution. Recent studies have demonstrated that attackers
                     can exploit off-the-shelf millimeter-wave radars to covertly detect even micron-scale
                     vibrations of smartphones caused by the earpiece during the phone conversation, eavesdropping
                     on audio information without the victim ever noticing. In our IEEE S&amp;P'25 paper, we
                     present a new architecture that not only thwarts such attacks but also injects false
                     signatures to fool eavesdroppers into believing they have succeeded. Here, we demonstrate
                     the eavesdropping countermeasure technique that enables the user to hide his private
                     acoustic signals and simultaneously inject an alternative signal via a low-profile,

                  <p>While the disaggregated architecture of the industry-driven Open Radio Access Network
                     (O-RAN) promises to foster vendor competition, accelerate innovation, and reduce cost
                     for 5G/6G cellular network deployments, it also exposes the cellular network to various
                     new cybersecurity and privacy vulnerabilities. This demo paper highlights one such
                     new potential cybersecurity vulnerability in the Radio Unit (RU) of O-RAN networks,
                     where an adversary can infer RU activity by analyzing electromagnetic side-channel
                     emissions. We present a custom-built, open-source cellular O-RAN testbed equipped
                     with EM measurement capabilities that enables direct observation of the FPGA-based
                     RU during operation. By capturing EM emissions from the RU, we extract side-channel
                     traces that reveal the underlying RU activity. These traces are then analyzed using
                     a Random Forest-based machine learning classifier, which accurately distinguishes
                     between different RU activity patterns. Our preliminary findings demonstrate the feasibility
                     of inferring RU-level operations via passive EM observation, highlighting a previously
                     unexplored security threat in O-RAN systems. All code and experimental artifacts are
